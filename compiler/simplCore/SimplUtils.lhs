Comment about interestingCallContext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want to avoid inlining an expression where there can't possibly be
any gain, such as in an argument position.  Hence, if the continuation
is interesting (eg. a case scrutinee, application etc.) then we
inline, otherwise we don't.  

Previously some_benefit used to return True only if the variable was
applied to some value arguments.  This didn't work:

	let x = _coerce_ (T Int) Int (I# 3) in
	case _coerce_ Int (T Int) x of
		I# y -> ....

we want to inline x, but can't see that it's a constructor in a case
scrutinee position, and some_benefit is False.

Another example:

dMonadST = _/\_ t -> :Monad (g1 _@_ t, g2 _@_ t, g3 _@_ t)

....  case dMonadST _@_ x0 of (a,b,c) -> ....

we'd really like to inline dMonadST here, but we *don't* want to
inline if the case expression is just

	case x of y { DEFAULT -> ... }

since we can just eliminate this case instead (x is in WHNF).  Similar
applies when x is bound to a lambda expression.  Hence
contIsInteresting looks for case expressions with just a single
default case.

\begin{code}
interestingCallContext :: Bool 		-- False <=> no args at all
		       -> Bool		-- False <=> no value args
		       -> SimplCont -> Bool
	-- The "lone-variable" case is important.  I spent ages
	-- messing about with unsatisfactory varaints, but this is nice.
	-- The idea is that if a variable appear all alone
	--	as an arg of lazy fn, or rhs	Stop
	-- 	as scrutinee of a case		Select
	--	as arg of a strict fn		ArgOf
	-- then we should not inline it (unless there is some other reason,
	-- e.g. is is the sole occurrence).  We achieve this by making
	-- interestingCallContext return False for a lone variable.
	--
	-- Why?  At least in the case-scrutinee situation, turning
	--	let x = (a,b) in case x of y -> ...
	-- into
	--	let x = (a,b) in case (a,b) of y -> ...
	-- and thence to 
	--	let x = (a,b) in let y = (a,b) in ...
	-- is bad if the binding for x will remain.
	--
	-- Another example: I discovered that strings
	-- were getting inlined straight back into applications of 'error'
	-- because the latter is strict.
	--	s = "foo"
	--	f = \x -> ...(error s)...

	-- Fundamentally such contexts should not ecourage inlining because
	-- the context can ``see'' the unfolding of the variable (e.g. case or a RULE)
	-- so there's no gain.
	--
	-- However, even a type application or coercion isn't a lone variable.
	-- Consider
	--	case $fMonadST @ RealWorld of { :DMonad a b c -> c }
	-- We had better inline that sucker!  The case won't see through it.
	--
	-- For now, I'm treating treating a variable applied to types 
	-- in a *lazy* context "lone". The motivating example was
	--	f = /\a. \x. BIG
	--	g = /\a. \y.  h (f a)
	-- There's no advantage in inlining f here, and perhaps
	-- a significant disadvantage.  Hence some_val_args in the Stop case

	-- Here the contIsInteresting makes the '*' keener to inline,

%************************************************************************

\subsection{Decisions about inlining}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

Inlining is controlled partly by the SimplifierMode switch.  This has two
settings:

	SimplGently	(a) Simplifying before specialiser/full laziness
			(b) Simplifiying inside INLINE pragma
			(c) Simplifying the LHS of a rule
			(d) Simplifying a GHCi expression or Template 
				Haskell splice

	SimplPhase n	Used at all other times

The key thing about SimplGently is that it does no call-site inlining.
Before full laziness we must be careful not to inline wrappers,
because doing so inhibits floating
    e.g. ...(case f x of ...)...
    ==> ...(case (case x of I# x# -> fw x#) of ...)...
    ==> ...(case x of I# x# -> case fw x# of ...)...
and now the redex (f x) isn't floatable any more.

The no-inlining thing is also important for Template Haskell.  You might be 
compiling in one-shot mode with -O2; but when TH compiles a splice before
running it, we don't want to use -O2.  Indeed, we don't want to inline
anything, because the byte-code interpreter might get confused about 
unboxed tuples and suchlike.

INLINE pragmas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimplGently is also used as the mode to simplify inside an InlineMe note.

\begin{code}
inlineMode :: SimplifierMode
inlineMode = SimplGently
\end{code}

It really is important to switch off inlinings inside such
expressions.  Consider the following example 

     	let f = \pq -> BIG
     	in
     	let g = \y -> f y y
	    {-# INLINE g #-}
     	in ...g...g...g...g...g...

Now, if that's the ONLY occurrence of f, it will be inlined inside g,
and thence copied multiple times when g is inlined.


This function may be inlinined in other modules, so we
don't want to remove (by inlining) calls to functions that have
specialisations, or that may have transformation rules in an importing
scope.

E.g. 	{-# INLINE f #-}
		f x = ...g...

and suppose that g is strict *and* has specialisations.  If we inline
g's wrapper, we deny f the chance of getting the specialised version
of g when f is inlined at some call site (perhaps in some other
module).

It's also important not to inline a worker back into a wrapper.
A wrapper looks like
	wraper = inline_me (\x -> ...worker... )
Normally, the inline_me prevents the worker getting inlined into
the wrapper (initially, the worker's only call site!).  But,
if the wrapper is sure to be called, the strictness analyser will
mark it 'demanded', so when the RHS is simplified, it'll get an ArgOf
continuation.  That's why the keep_inline predicate returns True for
ArgOf continuations.  It shouldn't do any harm not to dissolve the
inline-me note under these circumstances.

Note that the result is that we do very little simplification
inside an InlineMe.  

	all xs = foldr (&&) True xs
	any p = all . map p  {-# INLINE any #-}

Problem: any won't get deforested, and so if it's exported and the
importer doesn't use the inlining, (eg passes it as an arg) then we
won't get deforestation at all.  We havn't solved this problem yet!


preInlineUnconditionally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@preInlineUnconditionally@ examines a bndr to see if it is used just
once in a completely safe way, so that it is safe to discard the
binding inline its RHS at the (unique) usage site, REGARDLESS of how
big the RHS might be.  If this is the case we don't simplify the RHS
first, but just inline it un-simplified.

This is much better than first simplifying a perhaps-huge RHS and then
inlining and re-simplifying it.  Indeed, it can be at least quadratically
better.  Consider

	x1 = e1
	x2 = e2[x1]
	x3 = e3[x2]
	...etc...
	xN = eN[xN-1]

We may end up simplifying e1 N times, e2 N-1 times, e3 N-3 times etc.
This can happen with cascades of functions too:

	f1 = \x1.e1
	f2 = \xs.e2[f1]
	f3 = \xs.e3[f3]
	...etc...

THE MAIN INVARIANT is this:

	----  preInlineUnconditionally invariant -----
   IF preInlineUnconditionally chooses to inline x = <rhs>
   THEN doing the inlining should not change the occurrence
	info for the free vars of <rhs>
	----------------------------------------------

For example, it's tempting to look at trivial binding like
	x = y
and inline it unconditionally.  But suppose x is used many times,
but this is the unique occurrence of y.  Then inlining x would change
y's occurrence info, which breaks the invariant.  It matters: y
might have a BIG rhs, which will now be dup'd at every occurrenc of x.


Evne RHSs labelled InlineMe aren't caught here, because there might be
no benefit from inlining at the call site.

[Sept 01] Don't unconditionally inline a top-level thing, because that
can simply make a static thing into something built dynamically.  E.g.
	x = (a,b)
	main = \s -> h x

[Remember that we treat \s as a one-shot lambda.]  No point in
inlining x unless there is something interesting about the call site.

But watch out: if you aren't careful, some useful foldr/build fusion
can be lost (most notably in spectral/hartel/parstof) because the
foldr didn't see the build.  Doing the dynamic allocation isn't a big
deal, in fact, but losing the fusion can be.  But the right thing here
seems to be to do a callSiteInline based on the fact that there is
something interesting about the call site (it's strict).  Hmm.  That
seems a bit fragile.

Conclusion: inline top level things gaily until Phase 0 (the last
phase), at which point don't.

postInlineUnconditionally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@postInlineUnconditionally@ decides whether to unconditionally inline
a thing based on the form of its RHS; in particular if it has a
trivial RHS.  If so, we can inline and discard the binding altogether.

NB: a loop breaker has must_keep_binding = True and non-loop-breakers
only have *forward* references Hence, it's safe to discard the binding
	
NOTE: This isn't our last opportunity to inline.  We're at the binding
site right now, and we'll get another opportunity when we get to the
ocurrence(s)

Note that we do this unconditional inlining only for trival RHSs.
Don't inline even WHNFs inside lambdas; doing so may simply increase
allocation when the function is called. This isn't the last chance; see
NOTE above.

NB: Even inline pragmas (e.g. IMustBeINLINEd) are ignored here Why?
Because we don't even want to inline them into the RHS of constructor
arguments. See NOTE above

NB: At one time even NOINLINE was ignored here: if the rhs is trivial
it's best to inline it anyway.  We often get a=E; b=a from desugaring,
with both a and b marked NOINLINE.  But that seems incompatible with
our new view that inlining is like a RULE, so I'm sticking to the 'active'
story for now.

%*									*
%************************************************************************

We try for eta reduction here, but *only* if we get all the 
way to an exprIsTrivial expression.    
We don't want to remove extra lambdas unless we are going 
to avoid allocating this thing altogether

\begin{code}
tryEtaReduce :: [OutBinder] -> OutExpr -> Maybe OutExpr
tryEtaReduce bndrs body 
	-- We don't use CoreUtils.etaReduce, because we can be more
	-- efficient here:
	--  (a) we already have the binders
	--  (b) we can do the triviality test before computing the free vars
  = go (reverse bndrs) body
  where
    go (b : bs) (App fun arg) | ok_arg b arg = go bs fun	-- Loop round
    go []       fun           | ok_fun fun   = Just fun		-- Success!
    go _        _			     = Nothing		-- Failure!

    ok_fun fun =  exprIsTrivial fun
	       && not (any (`elemVarSet` (exprFreeVars fun)) bndrs)
	       && (exprIsHNF fun || all ok_lam bndrs)
    ok_lam v = isTyVar v || isDictId v
	-- The exprIsHNF is because eta reduction is not 
	-- valid in general:  \x. bot  /=  bot
	-- So we need to be sure that the "fun" is a value.
	--
	-- However, we always want to reduce (/\a -> f a) to f
	-- This came up in a RULE: foldr (build (/\a -> g a))
	--	did not match 	   foldr (build (/\b -> ...something complex...))
	-- The type checker can insert these eta-expanded versions,
	-- with both type and dictionary lambdas; hence the slightly 
	-- ad-hoc isDictTy

    ok_arg b arg = varToCoreExpr b `cheapEqExpr` arg
\end{code}


	Try eta expansion for RHSs

We go for:
   f = \x1..xn -> N  ==>   f = \x1..xn y1..ym -> N y1..ym
				 (n >= 0)

where (in both cases) 

	* The xi can include type variables

	* The yi are all value variables

	* N is a NORMAL FORM (i.e. no redexes anywhere)
	  wanting a suitable number of extra args.

We may have to sandwich some coerces between the lambdas
to make the types work.   exprEtaExpandArity looks through coerces
when computing arity; and etaExpand adds the coerces as necessary when
actually computing the expansion.

\begin{code}
tryEtaExpansion :: DynFlags -> OutExpr -> SimplM OutExpr
-- There is at least one runtime binder in the binders
tryEtaExpansion dflags body
  = getUniquesSmpl 			`thenSmpl` \ us ->
    returnSmpl (etaExpand fun_arity us body (exprType body))
  where
    fun_arity = exprEtaExpandArity dflags body
\end{code}


%************************************************************************
%*									*
\subsection{Floating lets out of big lambdas}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

tryRhsTyLam tries this transformation, when the big lambda appears as
the RHS of a let(rec) binding:

	/\abc -> let(rec) x = e in b
   ==>
	let(rec) x' = /\abc -> let x = x' a b c in e
	in 
	/\abc -> let x = x' a b c in b

This is good because it can turn things like:

	let f = /\a -> letrec g = ... g ... in g
into
	letrec g' = /\a -> ... g' a ...
	in
	let f = /\ a -> g' a

which is better.  In effect, it means that big lambdas don't impede
let-floating.

This optimisation is CRUCIAL in eliminating the junk introduced by
desugaring mutually recursive definitions.  Don't eliminate it lightly!

So far as the implementation is concerned:

	Invariant: go F e = /\tvs -> F e
	
	Equalities:
		go F (Let x=e in b)
		= Let x' = /\tvs -> F e 
		  in 
		  go G b
		where
		    G = F . Let x = x' tvs
	
		go F (Letrec xi=ei in b)
		= Letrec {xi' = /\tvs -> G ei} 
		  in
		  go G b
		where
		  G = F . Let {xi = xi' tvs}

[May 1999]  If we do this transformation *regardless* then we can
end up with some pretty silly stuff.  For example, 

	let 
	    st = /\ s -> let { x1=r1 ; x2=r2 } in ...
	in ..
becomes
	let y1 = /\s -> r1
	    y2 = /\s -> r2
	    st = /\s -> ...[y1 s/x1, y2 s/x2]
	in ..

Unless the "..." is a WHNF there is really no point in doing this.
Indeed it can make things worse.  Suppose x1 is used strictly,
and is of the form

	x1* = case f y of { (a,b) -> e }

If we abstract this wrt the tyvar we then can't do the case inline
as we would normally do.

mkCase puts a case expression back together, trying various transformations first.

       -> SimplM OutExpr

mkCase scrut case_bndr ty alts

    mkAlts dflags scrut case_bndr alts	`thenSmpl` \ better_alts ->
    mkCase1 scrut case_bndr ty better_alts
\end{code}


mkAlts tries these things:

1.  If several alternatives are identical, merge them into
    a single DEFAULT alternative.  I've occasionally seen this 
    making a big difference:

	case e of		=====>     case e of
	  C _ -> f x			     D v -> ....v....
	  D v -> ....v....		     DEFAULT -> f x
	  DEFAULT -> f x

   The point is that we merge common RHSs, at least for the DEFAULT case.
   [One could do something more elaborate but I've never seen it needed.]
   To avoid an expensive test, we just merge branches equal to the *first*
   alternative; this picks up the common cases
	a) all branches equal
	b) some branches equal to the DEFAULT (which occurs first)

2.  Case merging:
       case e of b {             ==>   case e of b {
    	 p1 -> rhs1	                 p1 -> rhs1
    	 ...	                         ...
    	 pm -> rhsm                      pm -> rhsm
    	 _  -> case b of b' {            pn -> let b'=b in rhsn
 		     pn -> rhsn          ...
 		     ...                 po -> let b'=b in rhso
 		     po -> rhso          _  -> let b'=b in rhsd
 		     _  -> rhsd
       }  
    
    which merges two cases in one case when -- the default alternative of
    the outer case scrutises the same variable as the outer case This
    transformation is called Case Merging.  It avoids that the same
    variable is scrutinised multiple times.


The case where transformation (1) showed up was like this (lib/std/PrelCError.lhs):

	x | p `is` 1 -> e1
	  | p `is` 2 -> e2
	...etc...

where @is@ was something like
	
	p `is` n = p /= (-1) && p == n

This gave rise to a horrible sequence of cases

	case p of
	  (-1) -> $j p
	  1    -> e1
	  DEFAULT -> $j p

and similarly in cascade for all the join points!

=================================================================================

mkCase1 tries these things

1.  Eliminate the case altogether if possible

2.  Case-identity:

	case e of 		===> e
		True  -> True;
		False -> False

    and similar friends.


Start with a simple situation:

	case x# of	===>   e[x#/y#]
	  y# -> e

(when x#, y# are of primitive type, of course).  We can't (in general)
do this for algebraic cases, because we might turn bottom into
non-bottom!

Actually, we generalise this idea to look for a case where we're
scrutinising a variable, and we know that only the default case can
match.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
	case x of
	  0#    -> ...
	  other -> ...(case x of
			 0#    -> ...
			 other -> ...) ...
\end{code}
Here the inner case can be eliminated.  This really only shows up in
eliminating error-checking code.

We also make sure that we deal with this very common case:

 	case e of 
	  x -> ...x...

Here we are using the case as a strict let; if x is used only once
then we want to inline it.  We have to be careful that this doesn't 
make the program terminate when it would have diverged before, so we
check that 
	- x is used strictly, or
	- e is already evaluated (it may so if e is a variable)

Lastly, we generalise the transformation to handle this:

	case e of	===> r
	   True  -> r
	   False -> r

We only do this for very cheaply compared r's (constructors, literals
and variables).  If pedantic bottoms is on, we only do it when the
scrutinee is a PrimOp which can't fail.

We do it *here*, looking at un-simplified alternatives, because we
have to check that r doesn't mention the variables bound by the
pattern in each alternative, so the binder-info is rather useful.

So the case-elimination algorithm is:

	1. Eliminate alternatives which can't match

	2. Check whether all the remaining alternatives
		(a) do not mention in their rhs any of the variables bound in their pattern
	   and  (b) have equal rhss

	3. Check we can safely ditch the case:
		   * PedanticBottoms is off,
		or * the scrutinee is an already-evaluated variable
		or * the scrutinee is a primop which is ok for speculation
			-- ie we want to preserve divide-by-zero errors, and
			-- calls to error itself!

		or * [Prim cases] the scrutinee is a primitive variable

		or * [Alg cases] the scrutinee is a variable and
		     either * the rhs is the same variable
			(eg case x of C a b -> x  ===>   x)
		     or     * there is only one alternative, the default alternative,
				and the binder is used strictly in its scope.
				[NB this is helped by the "use default binder where
				 possible" transformation; see below.]


If so, then we can replace the case with one of the rhss.

Further notes about case elimination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider:	test :: Integer -> IO ()
		test = print

Turns out that this compiles to:
    Print.test
      = \ eta :: Integer
	  eta1 :: State# RealWorld ->
	  case PrelNum.< eta PrelNum.zeroInteger of wild { __DEFAULT ->
	  case hPutStr stdout
		 (PrelNum.jtos eta ($w[] @ Char))
		 eta1
	  of wild1 { (# new_s, a4 #) -> PrelIO.lvl23 new_s  }}

Notice the strange '<' which has no effect at all. This is a funny one.  
It started like this:

f x y = if x < 0 then jtos x
          else if y==0 then "" else jtos x

At a particular call site we have (f v 1).  So we inline to get

	if v < 0 then jtos x 
	else if 1==0 then "" else jtos x

Now simplify the 1==0 conditional:

	if v<0 then jtos v else jtos v

Now common-up the two branches of the case:

	case (v<0) of DEFAULT -> jtos v

Why don't we drop the case?  Because it's strict in v.  It's technically
wrong to drop even unnecessary evaluations, and in practice they
may be a result of 'seq' so we *definitely* don't want to drop those.
I don't really know how to improve this situation.

When adding auxiliary bindings for the case binder, it's worth checking if
its dead, because it often is, and occasionally these mkCase transformations
cascade rather nicely.

\begin{code}
bindCaseBndr bndr rhs body
  | isDeadBinder bndr = body
  | otherwise	      = bindNonRec bndr rhs body
\end{code}
