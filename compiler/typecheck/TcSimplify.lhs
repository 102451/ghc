| *Test> runFoo foo
| 
| <interactive>:1:
|     Could not deduce (Bar a b) from the context (Foo a b)
|       arising from use of `foo' at <interactive>:1
|     Probable fix:
|         Add (Bar a b) to the expected type of an expression
|     In the first argument of `runFoo', namely `foo'
|     In the definition of `it': it = runFoo foo
| 
| Why all of the sudden does GHC need the constraint Bar a b? The
| function foo didn't ask for that... 

The trouble is that to type (runFoo foo), GHC has to solve the problem:

	Given constraint	Foo a b
	Solve constraint	Foo a b'

Notice that b and b' aren't the same.  To solve this, just do
improvement and then they are the same.  But GHC currently does
	simplify constraints
	apply improvement
	and loop

That is usually fine, but it isn't here, because it sees that Foo a b is
not the same as Foo a b', and so instead applies the instance decl for
instance Bar a b => Foo a b.  And that's where the Bar constraint comes
from.

The Right Thing is to improve whenever the constraint set changes at
all.  Not hard in principle, but it'll take a bit of fiddling to do.  



	--------------------------------------
		Notes on quantification
	--------------------------------------

Suppose we are about to do a generalisation step.
We have in our hand

	G	the environment
	T	the type of the RHS
	C	the constraints from that RHS

The game is to figure out

	Q	the set of type variables over which to quantify
	Ct	the constraints we will *not* quantify over
	Cq	the constraints we will quantify over

So we're going to infer the type

	forall Q. Cq => T

and float the constraints Ct further outwards.

Here are the things that *must* be true:

 (A)	Q intersect fv(G) = EMPTY			limits how big Q can be
 (B)	Q superset fv(Cq union T) \ oclose(fv(G),C)	limits how small Q can be

(A) says we can't quantify over a variable that's free in the
environment.  (B) says we must quantify over all the truly free
variables in T, else we won't get a sufficiently general type.  We do
not *need* to quantify over any variable that is fixed by the free
vars of the environment G.

	BETWEEN THESE TWO BOUNDS, ANY Q WILL DO!

Example:	class H x y | x->y where ...

	fv(G) = {a}	C = {H a b, H c d}
			T = c -> b

	(A)  Q intersect {a} is empty
	(B)  Q superset {a,b,c,d} \ oclose({a}, C) = {a,b,c,d} \ {a,b} = {c,d}

	So Q can be {c,d}, {b,c,d}

Other things being equal, however, we'd like to quantify over as few
variables as possible: smaller types, fewer type applications, more
constraints can get into Ct instead of Cq.


-----------------------------------------
We will make use of

  fv(T)	 	the free type vars of T

  oclose(vs,C)	The result of extending the set of tyvars vs
		using the functional dependencies from C

  grow(vs,C)	The result of extend the set of tyvars vs
		using all conceivable links from C.

		E.g. vs = {a}, C = {H [a] b, K (b,Int) c, Eq e}
		Then grow(vs,C) = {a,b,c}

		Note that grow(vs,C) `superset` grow(vs,simplify(C))
		That is, simplfication can only shrink the result of grow.

Notice that
   oclose is conservative one way:      v `elem` oclose(vs,C) => v is definitely fixed by vs
   grow is conservative the other way:  if v might be fixed by vs => v `elem` grow(vs,C)


-----------------------------------------

Choosing Q
~~~~~~~~~~
Here's a good way to choose Q:

	Q = grow( fv(T), C ) \ oclose( fv(G), C )

That is, quantify over all variable that that MIGHT be fixed by the
call site (which influences T), but which aren't DEFINITELY fixed by
G.  This choice definitely quantifies over enough type variables,
albeit perhaps too many.

Why grow( fv(T), C ) rather than fv(T)?  Consider

	class H x y | x->y where ...

	T = c->c
	C = (H c d)

  If we used fv(T) = {c} we'd get the type

	forall c. H c d => c -> b

  And then if the fn was called at several different c's, each of
  which fixed d differently, we'd get a unification error, because
  d isn't quantified.  Solution: quantify d.  So we must quantify
  everything that might be influenced by c.

Why not oclose( fv(T), C )?  Because we might not be able to see
all the functional dependencies yet:

	class H x y | x->y where ...
	instance H x y => Eq (T x y) where ...

	T = c->c
	C = (Eq (T c d))

  Now oclose(fv(T),C) = {c}, because the functional dependency isn't
  apparent yet, and that's wrong.  We must really quantify over d too.


There really isn't any point in quantifying over any more than
grow( fv(T), C ), because the call sites can't possibly influence
any other type variables.



	--------------------------------------
		Notes on ambiguity
	--------------------------------------

It's very hard to be certain when a type is ambiguous.  Consider

	class K x
	class H x y | x -> y
	instance H x y => K (x,y)

Is this type ambiguous?
	forall a b. (K (a,b), Eq b) => a -> a

Looks like it!  But if we simplify (K (a,b)) we get (H a b) and
now we see that a fixes b.  So we can't tell about ambiguity for sure
without doing a full simplification.  And even that isn't possible if
the context has some free vars that may get unified.  Urgle!

Here's another example: is this ambiguous?
	forall a b. Eq (T b) => a -> a
Not if there's an insance decl (with no context)
	instance Eq (T b) where ...

You may say of this example that we should use the instance decl right
away, but you can't always do that:

	class J a b where ...
	instance J Int b where ...

	f :: forall a b. J a b => a -> a

(Notice: no functional dependency in J's class decl.)
Here f's type is perfectly fine, provided f is only called at Int.
It's premature to complain when meeting f's signature, or even
when inferring a type for f.



However, we don't *need* to report ambiguity right away.  It'll always
show up at the call site.... and eventually at main, which needs special
treatment.  Nevertheless, reporting ambiguity promptly is an excellent thing.

So here's the plan.  We WARN about probable ambiguity if

	fv(Cq) is not a subset of  oclose(fv(T) union fv(G), C)

(all tested before quantification).
That is, all the type variables in Cq must be fixed by the the variables
in the environment, or by the variables in the type.

Notice that we union before calling oclose.  Here's an example:

	class J a b c | a b -> c
	fv(G) = {a}

Is this ambiguous?
	forall b c. (J a b c) => b -> b

Only if we union {a} from G with {b} from T before using oclose,
do we see that c is fixed.

It's a bit vague exactly which C we should use for this oclose call.  If we
don't fix enough variables we might complain when we shouldn't (see
the above nasty example).  Nothing will be perfect.  That's why we can
only issue a warning.


Can we ever be *certain* about ambiguity?  Yes: if there's a constraint

	c in C such that fv(c) intersect (fv(G) union fv(T)) = EMPTY

then c is a "bubble"; there's no way it can ever improve, and it's
certainly ambiguous.  UNLESS it is a constant (sigh).  And what about
the nasty example?

	class K x
	class H x y | x -> y
	instance H x y => K (x,y)

Is this type ambiguous?
	forall a b. (K (a,b), Eq b) => a -> a

Urk.  The (Eq b) looks "definitely ambiguous" but it isn't.  What we are after
is a "bubble" that's a set of constraints

	Cq = Ca union Cq'  st  fv(Ca) intersect (fv(Cq') union fv(T) union fv(G)) = EMPTY

Hence another idea.  To decide Q start with fv(T) and grow it
by transitive closure in Cq (no functional dependencies involved).
Now partition Cq using Q, leaving the definitely-ambiguous and probably-ok.
The definitely-ambiguous can then float out, and get smashed at top level
(which squashes out the constants, like Eq (T a) above)


	--------------------------------------
		Notes on principal types
	--------------------------------------

    class C a where
      op :: a -> a

    f x = let g y = op (y::Int) in True

Here the principal type of f is (forall a. a->a)
but we'll produce the non-principal type
    f :: forall a. C Int => a -> a


	--------------------------------------
	The need for forall's in constraints
	--------------------------------------

[Exchange on Haskell Cafe 5/6 Dec 2000]

  class C t where op :: t -> Bool
  instance C [t] where op x = True

  p y = (let f :: c -> Bool; f x = op (y >> return x) in f, y ++ [])
  q y = (y ++ [], let f :: c -> Bool; f x = op (y >> return x) in f)

The definitions of p and q differ only in the order of the components in
the pair on their right-hand sides.  And yet:

  ghc and "Typing Haskell in Haskell" reject p, but accept q;
  Hugs rejects q, but accepts p;
  hbc rejects both p and q;
  nhc98 ... (Malcolm, can you fill in the blank for us!).

The type signature for f forces context reduction to take place, and
the results of this depend on whether or not the type of y is known,
which in turn depends on which component of the pair the type checker
analyzes first.  

Solution: if y::m a, float out the constraints
	Monad m, forall c. C (m c)
When m is later unified with [], we can solve both constraints.


	--------------------------------------
		Notes on implicit parameters
	--------------------------------------

Question 1: can we "inherit" implicit parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:

	f x = (x::Int) + ?y

where f is *not* a top-level binding.
From the RHS of f we'll get the constraint (?y::Int).
There are two types we might infer for f:

	f :: Int -> Int

(so we get ?y from the context of f's definition), or

	f :: (?y::Int) => Int -> Int

At first you might think the first was better, becuase then
?y behaves like a free variable of the definition, rather than
having to be passed at each call site.  But of course, the WHOLE
IDEA is that ?y should be passed at each call site (that's what
dynamic binding means) so we'd better infer the second.

BOTTOM LINE: when *inferring types* you *must* quantify 
over implicit parameters. See the predicate isFreeWhenInferring.


Question 2: type signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BUT WATCH OUT: When you supply a type signature, we can't force you
to quantify over implicit parameters.  For example:

	(?x + 1) :: Int

This is perfectly reasonable.  We do not want to insist on

	(?x + 1) :: (?x::Int => Int)

That would be silly.  Here, the definition site *is* the occurrence site,
so the above strictures don't apply.  Hence the difference between
tcSimplifyCheck (which *does* allow implicit paramters to be inherited)
and tcSimplifyCheckBind (which does not).

What about when you supply a type signature for a binding?
Is it legal to give the following explicit, user type 
signature to f, thus:

	f :: Int -> Int
	f x = (x::Int) + ?y

At first sight this seems reasonable, but it has the nasty property
that adding a type signature changes the dynamic semantics.
Consider this:

	(let f x = (x::Int) + ?y
 	 in (f 3, f 3 with ?y=5))  with ?y = 6

		returns (3+6, 3+5)
vs
	(let f :: Int -> Int
	     f x = x + ?y
	 in (f 3, f 3 with ?y=5))  with ?y = 6

		returns (3+6, 3+6)

Indeed, simply inlining f (at the Haskell source level) would change the
dynamic semantics.

Nevertheless, as Launchbury says (email Oct 01) we can't really give the
semantics for a Haskell program without knowing its typing, so if you 
change the typing you may change the semantics.

To make things consistent in all cases where we are *checking* against
a supplied signature (as opposed to inferring a type), we adopt the
rule: 

	a signature does not need to quantify over implicit params.

[This represents a (rather marginal) change of policy since GHC 5.02,
which *required* an explicit signature to quantify over all implicit
params for the reasons mentioned above.]

But that raises a new question.  Consider 

	Given (signature)	?x::Int
	Wanted (inferred)	?x::Int, ?y::Bool

Clearly we want to discharge the ?x and float the ?y out.  But
what is the criterion that distinguishes them?  Clearly it isn't
what free type variables they have.  The Right Thing seems to be
to float a constraint that
	neither mentions any of the quantified type variables
	nor any of the quantified implicit parameters

See the predicate isFreeWhenChecking.


Question 3: monomorphism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a nasty corner case when the monomorphism restriction bites:

	z = (x::Int) + ?y

The argument above suggests that we *must* generalise
over the ?y parameter, to get
	z :: (?y::Int) => Int,
but the monomorphism restriction says that we *must not*, giving
	z :: Int.
Why does the momomorphism restriction say this?  Because if you have

	let z = x + ?y in z+z

you might not expect the addition to be done twice --- but it will if
we follow the argument of Question 2 and generalise over ?y.


Question 4: top level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the top level, monomorhism makes no sense at all.

    module Main where
	main = let ?x = 5 in print foo

	foo = woggle 3

	woggle :: (?x :: Int) => Int -> Int
	woggle y = ?x + y

We definitely don't want (foo :: Int) with a top-level implicit parameter
(?x::Int) becuase there is no way to bind it.  


Possible choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(A) Always generalise over implicit parameters
    Bindings that fall under the monomorphism restriction can't
	be generalised

    Consequences:
	* Inlining remains valid
	* No unexpected loss of sharing
	* But simple bindings like
		z = ?y + 1
	  will be rejected, unless you add an explicit type signature
	  (to avoid the monomorphism restriction)
		z :: (?y::Int) => Int
		z = ?y + 1
	  This seems unacceptable

(B) Monomorphism restriction "wins"
    Bindings that fall under the monomorphism restriction can't
	be generalised
    Always generalise over implicit parameters *except* for bindings
	that fall under the monomorphism restriction

    Consequences
	* Inlining isn't valid in general
	* No unexpected loss of sharing
	* Simple bindings like
		z = ?y + 1
	  accepted (get value of ?y from binding site)

(C) Always generalise over implicit parameters
    Bindings that fall under the monomorphism restriction can't
	be generalised, EXCEPT for implicit parameters
    Consequences
	* Inlining remains valid
	* Unexpected loss of sharing (from the extra generalisation)
	* Simple bindings like
		z = ?y + 1
	  accepted (get value of ?y from occurrence sites)


Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~
None of these choices seems very satisfactory.  But at least we should
decide which we want to do.

It's really not clear what is the Right Thing To Do.  If you see

	z = (x::Int) + ?y

would you expect the value of ?y to be got from the *occurrence sites*
of 'z', or from the valuue of ?y at the *definition* of 'z'?  In the
case of function definitions, the answer is clearly the former, but
less so in the case of non-fucntion definitions.   On the other hand,
if we say that we get the value of ?y from the definition site of 'z',
then inlining 'z' might change the semantics of the program.

Choice (C) really says "the monomorphism restriction doesn't apply
to implicit parameters".  Which is fine, but remember that every
innocent binding 'x = ...' that mentions an implicit parameter in
the RHS becomes a *function* of that parameter, called at each
use of 'x'.  Now, the chances are that there are no intervening 'with'
clauses that bind ?y, so a decent compiler should common up all
those function calls.  So I think I strongly favour (C).  Indeed,
one could make a similar argument for abolishing the monomorphism
restriction altogether.

BOTTOM LINE: we choose (B) at present.  See tcSimplifyRestricted



%************************************************************************

\subsection{tcSimplifyInfer}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

tcSimplify is called when we *inferring* a type.  Here's the overall game plan:

    1. Compute Q = grow( fvs(T), C )

    2. Partition C based on Q into Ct and Cq.  Notice that ambiguous
       predicates will end up in Ct; we deal with them at the top level

    3. Try improvement, using functional dependencies

    4. If Step 3 did any unification, repeat from step 1
       (Unification can change the result of 'grow'.)

Note: we don't reduce dictionaries in step 2.  For example, if we have
Eq (a,b), we don't simplify to (Eq a, Eq b).  So Q won't be different
after step 2.  However note that we may therefore quantify over more
type variables than we absolutely have to.

For the guts, we need a loop, that alternates context reduction and
improvement with unification.  E.g. Suppose we have

	class C x y | x->y where ...

and tcSimplify is called with:
	(C Int a, C Int b)
Then improvement unifies a with b, giving
	(C Int a, C Int a)

If we need to unify anything, we rattle round the whole thing all over
again.

    if no_improvement then
	returnM (varSetElems qtvs, frees, binds, irreds)
    else
	-- If improvement did some unification, we go round again.  There
	-- are two subtleties:
	--   a) We start again with irreds, not wanteds
	-- 	Using an instance decl might have introduced a fresh type variable
	--	which might have been unified, so we'd get an infinite loop
	--	if we started again with wanteds!  See example [LOOP]
	--
	--   b) It's also essential to re-process frees, because unification
	--      might mean that a type variable that looked free isn't now.
	--
	-- Hence the (irreds ++ frees)

	-- However, NOTICE that when we are done, we might have some bindings, but
	-- the final qtvs might be empty.  See [NO TYVARS] below.
				
	inferLoop doc tau_tvs (irreds ++ frees)	`thenM` \ (qtvs1, frees1, binds1, irreds1) ->
	returnM (qtvs1, frees1, binds `unionBags` binds1, irreds1)
\end{code}

Example [LOOP]

	class If b t e r | b t e -> r
	instance If T t e t
	instance If F t e e
	class Lte a b c | a b -> c where lte :: a -> b -> c
	instance Lte Z b T
	instance (Lte a b l,If l b a c) => Max a b c

Wanted:	Max Z (S x) y

Then we'll reduce using the Max instance to:
	(Lte Z (S x) l, If l (S x) Z y)
and improve by binding l->T, after which we can do some reduction
on both the Lte and If constraints.  What we *can't* do is start again
with (Max Z (S x) y)!

[NO TYVARS]

	class Y a b | a -> b where
	    y :: a -> X b
	
	instance Y [[a]] a where
	    y ((x:_):_) = X x
	
	k :: X a -> X a -> X a

	g :: Num a => [X a] -> [X a]
	g xs = h xs
	    where
	    h ys = ys ++ map (k (y [[0]])) xs

The excitement comes when simplifying the bindings for h.  Initially
try to simplify {y @ [[t1]] t2, 0 @ t1}, with initial qtvs = {t2}.
From this we get t1:=:t2, but also various bindings.  We can't forget
the bindings (because of [LOOP]), but in fact t1 is what g is
polymorphic in.  

The net effect of [NO TYVARS] 

\begin{code}
isFreeWhenInferring :: TyVarSet -> Inst	-> Bool
isFreeWhenInferring qtvs inst
  =  isFreeWrtTyVars qtvs inst		-- Constrains no quantified vars
  && isInheritableInst inst		-- And no implicit parameter involved
					-- (see "Notes on implicit parameters")

isFreeWhenChecking :: TyVarSet	-- Quantified tyvars
	 	   -> NameSet	-- Quantified implicit parameters
		   -> Inst -> Bool
isFreeWhenChecking qtvs ips inst
  =  isFreeWrtTyVars qtvs inst
  && isFreeWrtIPs    ips inst

isFreeWrtTyVars qtvs inst = not (tyVarsOfInst inst `intersectsVarSet` qtvs)
isFreeWrtIPs     ips inst = not (any (`elemNameSet` ips) (ipNamesOfInst inst))
\end{code}

%*									*
%************************************************************************

Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 1]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have to be very, very careful when generating superclasses, lest we
accidentally build a loop. Here's an example:

  class S a

  class S a => C a where { opc :: a -> a }
  class S b => D b where { opd :: b -> b }
  
  instance C Int where
     opc = opd
  
  instance D Int where
     opd = opc

From (instance C Int) we get the constraint set {ds1:S Int, dd:D Int}
Simplifying, we may well get:
	$dfCInt = :C ds1 (opd dd)
	dd  = $dfDInt
	ds1 = $p1 dd
Notice that we spot that we can extract ds1 from dd.  

Alas!  Alack! We can do the same for (instance D Int):

	$dfDInt = :D ds2 (opc dc)
	dc  = $dfCInt
	ds2 = $p1 dc

And now we've defined the superclass in terms of itself.

Solution: never generate a superclass selectors at all when
satisfying the superclass context of an instance declaration.

Two more nasty cases are in
	tcrun021
	tcrun033

\begin{code}
tcSimplifySuperClasses qtvs givens sc_wanteds
  = ASSERT( all isSkolemTyVar qtvs )
    do	{ (_, frees, binds1) <- tcSimplCheck doc get_qtvs NoSCs givens sc_wanteds
	; binds2	     <- tc_simplify_top doc False NoSCs frees
	; return (binds1 `unionBags` binds2) }
  where
    get_qtvs = return (mkVarSet qtvs)
    doc = ptext SLIT("instance declaration superclass context")
\end{code}


%************************************************************************
%*									*
\subsection{tcSimplifyRestricted}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

tcSimplifyRestricted infers which type variables to quantify for a 
group of restricted bindings.  This isn't trivial.

Eg1:	id = \x -> x
	We want to quantify over a to get id :: forall a. a->a
	
Eg2:	eq = (==)
	We do not want to quantify over a, because there's an Eq a 
	constraint, so we get eq :: a->a->Bool	(notice no forall)

So, assume:
	RHS has type 'tau', whose free tyvars are tau_tvs
	RHS has constraints 'wanteds'

Plan A (simple)
  Quantify over (tau_tvs \ ftvs(wanteds))
  This is bad. The constraints may contain (Monad (ST s))
  where we have 	instance Monad (ST s) where...
  so there's no need to be monomorphic in s!

  Also the constraint might be a method constraint,
  whose type mentions a perfectly innocent tyvar:
	  op :: Num a => a -> b -> a
  Here, b is unconstrained.  A good example would be
	foo = op (3::Int)
  We want to infer the polymorphic type
	foo :: forall b. b -> b


Plan B (cunning, used for a long time up to and including GHC 6.2)
  Step 1: Simplify the constraints as much as possible (to deal 
  with Plan A's problem).  Then set
	qtvs = tau_tvs \ ftvs( simplify( wanteds ) )

  Step 2: Now simplify again, treating the constraint as 'free' if 
  it does not mention qtvs, and trying to reduce it otherwise.
  The reasons for this is to maximise sharing.

  This fails for a very subtle reason.  Suppose that in the Step 2
  a constraint (Foo (Succ Zero) (Succ Zero) b) gets thrown upstairs as 'free'.
  In the Step 1 this constraint might have been simplified, perhaps to
  (Foo Zero Zero b), AND THEN THAT MIGHT BE IMPROVED, to bind 'b' to 'T'.
  This won't happen in Step 2... but that in turn might prevent some other
  constraint (Baz [a] b) being simplified (e.g. via instance Baz [a] T where {..}) 
  and that in turn breaks the invariant that no constraints are quantified over.

  Test typecheck/should_compile/tc177 (which failed in GHC 6.2) demonstrates
  the problem.


Plan C (brutal)
  Step 1: Simplify the constraints as much as possible (to deal 
  with Plan A's problem).  Then set
	qtvs = tau_tvs \ ftvs( simplify( wanteds ) )
  Return the bindings from Step 1.
  

A note about Plan C (arising from "bug" reported by George Russel March 2004)
Consider this:

      instance (HasBinary ty IO) => HasCodedValue ty

      foo :: HasCodedValue a => String -> IO a

      doDecodeIO :: HasCodedValue a => () -> () -> IO a
      doDecodeIO codedValue view  
        = let { act = foo "foo" } in  act

You might think this should work becuase the call to foo gives rise to a constraint
(HasCodedValue t), which can be satisfied by the type sig for doDecodeIO.  But the
restricted binding act = ... calls tcSimplifyRestricted, and PlanC simplifies the
constraint using the (rather bogus) instance declaration, and now we are stuffed.

I claim this is not really a bug -- but it bit Sergey as well as George.  So here's
plan D


Plan D (a variant of plan B)
  Step 1: Simplify the constraints as much as possible (to deal 
  with Plan A's problem), BUT DO NO IMPROVEMENT.  Then set
	qtvs = tau_tvs \ ftvs( simplify( wanteds ) )

  Step 2: Now simplify again, treating the constraint as 'free' if 
  it does not mention qtvs, and trying to reduce it otherwise.

  The point here is that it's generally OK to have too few qtvs; that is,
  to make the thing more monomorphic than it could be.  We don't want to
  do that in the common cases, but in wierd cases it's ok: the programmer
  can always add a signature.  

  Too few qtvs => too many wanteds, which is what happens if you do less
  improvement.

%************************************************************************
%*									*
		tcSimplifyRuleLhs
%*									*
%************************************************************************

On the LHS of transformation rules we only simplify methods and constants,
getting dictionaries.  We want to keep all of them unsimplified, to serve
as the available stuff for the RHS of the rule.

Example.  Consider the following left-hand side of a rule
	
	f (x == y) (y > z) = ...

If we typecheck this expression we get constraints

	d1 :: Ord a, d2 :: Eq a

We do NOT want to "simplify" to the LHS

	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a.
	  f ((==) (eqFromOrd d1) x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...

Instead we want	

	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Ord a, d2::Eq a.
	  f ((==) d2 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...

Here is another example:

	fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
	{-# RULES "foo"  fromIntegral = id :: Int -> Int #-}

In the rule, a=b=Int, and Num Int is a superclass of Integral Int. But
we *dont* want to get

	forall dIntegralInt.
	   fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt (scsel dIntegralInt) = id Int

because the scsel will mess up RULE matching.  Instead we want

	forall dIntegralInt, dNumInt.
	  fromIntegral Int Int dIntegralInt dNumInt = id Int

Even if we have 

	g (x == y) (y == z) = ..

where the two dictionaries are *identical*, we do NOT WANT

	forall x::a, y::a, z::a, d1::Eq a
	  f ((==) d1 x y) ((>) d1 y z) = ...

because that will only match if the dict args are (visibly) equal.
Instead we want to quantify over the dictionaries separately.

In short, tcSimplifyRuleLhs must *only* squash LitInst and MethInts, leaving
all dicts unchanged, with absolutely no sharing.  It's simpler to do this
from scratch, rather than further parameterise simpleReduceLoop etc

\begin{code}
tcSimplifyRuleLhs :: [Inst] -> TcM ([Inst], TcDictBinds)
tcSimplifyRuleLhs wanteds
  = go [] emptyBag wanteds
  where
    go dicts binds []
	= return (dicts, binds)
    go dicts binds (w:ws)
	| isDict w
	= go (w:dicts) binds ws
	| otherwise
	= do { w' <- zonkInst w  -- So that (3::Int) does not generate a call
				 -- to fromInteger; this looks fragile to me
	     ; lookup_result <- lookupInst w'
	     ; case lookup_result of
		 GenInst ws' rhs -> go dicts (addBind binds w rhs) (ws' ++ ws)
		 SimpleInst rhs  -> go dicts (addBind binds w rhs) ws
		 NoInstance	 -> pprPanic "tcSimplifyRuleLhs" (ppr w)
	  }
\end{code}

tcSimplifyBracket is used when simplifying the constraints arising from
a Template Haskell bracket [| ... |].  We want to check that there aren't
any constraints that can't be satisfied (e.g. Show Foo, where Foo has no
Show instance), but we aren't otherwise interested in the results.
Nor do we care about ambiguous dictionaries etc.  We will type check
this bracket again at its usage site.

\begin{code}
tcSimplifyBracket :: [Inst] -> TcM ()
tcSimplifyBracket wanteds
  = simpleReduceLoop doc reduceMe wanteds	`thenM_`
    returnM ()
  where
    doc = text "tcSimplifyBracket"
\end{code}

\subsection{Filtering at a dynamic binding}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

When we have
	let ?x = R in B

we must discharge all the ?x constraints from B.  We also do an improvement
step; if we have ?x::t1 and ?x::t2 we must unify t1, t2.

Actually, the constraints from B might improve the types in ?x. For example

	f :: (?x::Int) => Char -> Char
	let ?x = 3 in f 'c'

then the constraint (?x::Int) arising from the call to f will
force the binding for ?x to be of type Int.

\begin{code}
tcSimplifyIPs :: [Inst]		-- The implicit parameters bound here
	      -> [Inst]		-- Wanted

        if no_improvement then
	    ASSERT( null irreds )
	    returnM (frees, binds)
	else
	    simpl_loop givens' (irreds ++ frees)	`thenM` \ (frees1, binds1) ->

%*									*
\subsection[binds-for-local-funs]{@bindInstsOfLocalFuns@}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

When doing a binding group, we may have @Insts@ of local functions.
For example, we might have...
\begin{verbatim}
let f x = x + 1	    -- orig local function (overloaded)
    f.1 = f Int	    -- two instances of f
    f.2 = f Float
 in
    (f.1 5, f.2 6.7)
\end{verbatim}
The point is: we must drop the bindings for @f.1@ and @f.2@ here,
where @f@ is in scope; those @Insts@ must certainly not be passed
upwards towards the top-level.	If the @Insts@ were binding-ified up
there, they would have unresolvable references to @f@.

We pass in an @init_lie@ of @Insts@ and a list of locally-bound @Ids@.
For each method @Inst@ in the @init_lie@ that mentions one of the
@Ids@, we create a binding.  We return the remaining @Insts@ (in an
@LIE@), as well as the @HsBinds@ generated.

\begin{code}
bindInstsOfLocalFuns ::	[Inst] -> [TcId] -> TcM TcDictBinds
-- Simlifies only MethodInsts, and generate only bindings of form 
--	fm = f tys dicts
-- We're careful not to even generate bindings of the form

-- arguably a bug in Match.tidyEqnInfo (see notes there)

Note [SUPERCLASS-LOOP 2]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
But the above isn't enough.  Suppose we are *given* d1:Ord a,
and want to deduce (d2:C [a]) where

	class Ord a => C a where
	instance Ord [a] => C [a] where ...

Then we'll use the instance decl to deduce C [a] from Ord [a], and then add the
superclasses of C [a] to avails.  But we must not overwrite the binding
for Ord [a] (which is obtained from Ord a) with a superclass selection or we'll just
build a loop! 

Here's another variant, immortalised in tcrun020
	class Monad m => C1 m
	class C1 m => C2 m x
	instance C2 Maybe Bool
For the instance decl we need to build (C1 Maybe), and it's no good if
we run around and add (C2 Maybe Bool) and its superclasses to the avails 
before we search for C1 Maybe.

Here's another example 
 	class Eq b => Foo a b
	instance Eq a => Foo [a] a
If we are reducing
	(Foo [t] t)

we'll first deduce that it holds (via the instance decl).  We must not
then overwrite the Eq t constraint with a superclass selection!

At first I had a gross hack, whereby I simply did not add superclass constraints
in addWanted, though I did for addGiven and addIrred.  This was sub-optimal,
becuase it lost legitimate superclass sharing, and it still didn't do the job:
I found a very obscure program (now tcrun021) in which improvement meant the
simplifier got two bites a the cherry... so something seemed to be an Irred
first time, but reducible next time.

Now we implement the Right Solution, which is to check for loops directly 
when adding superclasses.  It's a bit like the occurs check in unification.


Note [RECURSIVE DICTIONARIES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider 
    data D r = ZeroD | SuccD (r (D r));
    
    instance (Eq (r (D r))) => Eq (D r) where
        ZeroD     == ZeroD     = True
        (SuccD a) == (SuccD b) = a == b
        _         == _         = False;
    
    equalDC :: D [] -> D [] -> Bool;
    equalDC = (==);

We need to prove (Eq (D [])).  Here's how we go:

	d1 : Eq (D [])

by instance decl, holds if
	d2 : Eq [D []]
	where 	d1 = dfEqD d2

by instance decl of Eq, holds if
	d3 : D []
	where	d2 = dfEqList d3
		d1 = dfEqD d2

But now we can "tie the knot" to give

	d3 = d1
	d2 = dfEqList d3
	d1 = dfEqD d2

and it'll even run!  The trick is to put the thing we are trying to prove
(in this case Eq (D []) into the database before trying to prove its
contributing clauses.

@tcSimplifyTop@ is called once per module to simplify all the constant
and ambiguous Insts.

We need to be careful of one case.  Suppose we have

	instance Num a => Num (Foo a b) where ...

and @tcSimplifyTop@ is given a constraint (Num (Foo x y)).  Then it'll simplify
to (Num x), and default x to Int.  But what about y??

It's OK: the final zonking stage should zap y to (), which is fine.

If a dictionary constrains a type variable which is
	* not mentioned in the environment
	* and not mentioned in the type of the expression
then it is ambiguous. No further information will arise to instantiate
the type variable; nor will it be generalised and turned into an extra
parameter to a function.

It is an error for this to occur, except that Haskell provided for
certain rules to be applied in the special case of numeric types.
Specifically, if
	* at least one of its classes is a numeric class, and
	* all of its classes are numeric or standard
then the type variable can be defaulted to the first type in the
default-type list which is an instance of all the offending classes.

So here is the function which does the work.  It takes the ambiguous
dictionaries and either resolves them (producing bindings) or
complains.  It works by splitting the dictionary list by type
variable, and using @disambigOne@ to do the real business.

@disambigOne@ assumes that its arguments dictionaries constrain all
the same type variable.

ADR Comment 20/6/94: I've changed the @CReturnable@ case to default to
@()@ instead of @Int@.  I reckon this is the Right Thing to do since
the most common use of defaulting is code like:
\begin{verbatim}
	_ccall_ foo	`seqPrimIO` bar
\end{verbatim}
Since we're not using the result of @foo@, the result if (presumably)
@void@.

\begin{code}
disambigGroup :: [Inst]	-- All standard classes of form (C a)
	      -> TcM TcDictBinds

disambigGroup dicts
  = 	-- THE DICTS OBEY THE DEFAULTABLE CONSTRAINT
	-- SO, TRY DEFAULT TYPES IN ORDER

	-- Failure here is caused by there being no type in the
	-- default list which can satisfy all the ambiguous classes.
	-- For example, if Real a is reqd, but the only type in the
	-- default list is Int.
    get_default_tys			`thenM` \ default_tys ->
    let
      try_default [] 	-- No defaults work, so fail
	= failM

      try_default (default_ty : default_tys)
	= tryTcLIE_ (try_default default_tys) $	-- If default_ty fails, we try
						-- default_tys instead
	  tcSimplifyDefault theta		`thenM` \ _ ->
	  returnM default_ty
        where
	  theta = [mkClassPred clas [default_ty] | clas <- classes]
    in
	-- See if any default works
    tryM (try_default default_tys)	`thenM` \ mb_ty ->
    case mb_ty of
	Left  _ 		-> bomb_out
	Right chosen_default_ty -> choose_default chosen_default_ty
  where
    tyvar   = get_tv (head dicts)	-- Should be non-empty
    classes = map get_clas dicts

    choose_default default_ty	-- Commit to tyvar = default_ty
      =	-- Bind the type variable 
	unifyType default_ty (mkTyVarTy tyvar)	`thenM_`
	-- and reduce the context, for real this time
	simpleReduceLoop (text "disambig" <+> ppr dicts)
		         reduceMe dicts			`thenM` \ (frees, binds, ambigs) ->
	WARN( not (null frees && null ambigs), ppr frees $$ ppr ambigs )
	warnDefault dicts default_ty			`thenM_`
	returnM binds

    bomb_out = addTopAmbigErrs dicts	`thenM_`
	       returnM emptyBag

get_default_tys
  = do 	{ mb_defaults <- getDefaultTys
	; case mb_defaults of
		Just tys -> return tys
		Nothing  -> 	-- No use-supplied default;
				-- use [Integer, Double]
			    do { integer_ty <- tcMetaTy integerTyConName
			       ; checkWiredInTyCon doubleTyCon
			       ; return [integer_ty, doubleTy] } }
\end{code}

[Aside - why the defaulting mechanism is turned off when
 dealing with arguments and results to ccalls.

When typechecking _ccall_s, TcExpr ensures that the external
function is only passed arguments (and in the other direction,
results) of a restricted set of 'native' types.

The interaction between the defaulting mechanism for numeric
values and CC & CR can be a bit puzzling to the user at times.
For example,

    x <- _ccall_ f
    if (x /= 0) then
       _ccall_ g x
     else
       return ()

What type has 'x' got here? That depends on the default list
in operation, if it is equal to Haskell 98's default-default
of (Integer, Double), 'x' has type Double, since Integer
is not an instance of CR. If the default list is equal to
Haskell 1.4's default-default of (Int, Double), 'x' has type
Int.

Much simpler versions when there are no bindings to make!

@tcSimplifyThetas@ simplifies class-type constraints formed by
@deriving@ declarations and when specialising instances.  We are
only interested in the simplified bunch of class/type constraints.

It simplifies to constraints of the form (C a b c) where
a,b,c are type variables.  This is required for the context of
instance declarations.

@tcSimplifyDefault@ just checks class-type constraints, essentially;
used with \tr{default} declarations.  We are only interested in
whether it worked or not.
