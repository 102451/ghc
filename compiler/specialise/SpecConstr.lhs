-----------------------------------------------------
			Game plan
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider
	drop n []     = []
	drop 0 xs     = []
	drop n (x:xs) = drop (n-1) xs

After the first time round, we could pass n unboxed.  This happens in
numerical code too.  Here's what it looks like in Core:

	drop n xs = case xs of
		      []     -> []
		      (y:ys) -> case n of 
				  I# n# -> case n# of
					     0 -> []
					     _ -> drop (I# (n# -# 1#)) xs

Notice that the recursive call has an explicit constructor as argument.
Noticing this, we can make a specialised version of drop
	
	RULE: drop (I# n#) xs ==> drop' n# xs

	drop' n# xs = let n = I# n# in ...orig RHS...

Now the simplifier will apply the specialisation in the rhs of drop', giving

	drop' n# xs = case xs of
		      []     -> []
		      (y:ys) -> case n# of
				  0 -> []
				  _ -> drop (n# -# 1#) xs

Much better!  

We'd also like to catch cases where a parameter is carried along unchanged,
but evaluated each time round the loop:

	f i n = if i>0 || i>n then i else f (i*2) n

Here f isn't strict in n, but we'd like to avoid evaluating it each iteration.
In Core, by the time we've w/wd (f is strict in i) we get

	f i# n = case i# ># 0 of
		   False -> I# i#
		   True  -> case n of n' { I# n# ->
			    case i# ># n# of
				False -> I# i#
				True  -> f (i# *# 2#) n'

At the call to f, we see that the argument, n is know to be (I# n#),
and n is evaluated elsewhere in the body of f, so we can play the same
trick as above.  


Note [Reboxing]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must be careful not to allocate the same constructor twice.  Consider
	f p = (...(case p of (a,b) -> e)...p...,
	       ...let t = (r,s) in ...t...(f t)...)
At the recursive call to f, we can see that t is a pair.  But we do NOT want
to make a specialised copy:
	f' a b = let p = (a,b) in (..., ...)
because now t is allocated by the caller, then r and s are passed to the
recursive call, which allocates the (r,s) pair again.

This happens if
  (a) the argument p is used in other than a case-scrutinsation way.
  (b) the argument to the call is not a 'fresh' tuple; you have to
	look into its unfolding to see that it's a tuple

Hence the "OR" part of Note [Good arguments] below.

ALTERNATIVE 2: pass both boxed and unboxed versions.  This no longer saves
allocation, but does perhaps save evals. In the RULE we'd have
something like

  f (I# x#) = f' (I# x#) x#

If at the call site the (I# x) was an unfolding, then we'd have to
rely on CSE to eliminate the duplicate allocation.... This alternative
doesn't look attractive enough to pursue.

ALTERNATIVE 3: ignore the reboxing problem.  The trouble is that 
the conservative reboxing story prevents many useful functions from being
specialised.  Example:
	foo :: Maybe Int -> Int -> Int
	foo   (Just m) 0 = 0
	foo x@(Just m) n = foo x (n-m)
Here the use of 'x' will clearly not require boxing in the specialised function.

The strictness analyser has the same problem, in fact.  Example:
	f p@(a,b) = ...
If we pass just 'a' and 'b' to the worker, it might need to rebox the
pair to create (a,b).  A more sophisticated analysis might figure out
precisely the cases in which this could happen, but the strictness
analyser does no such analysis; it just passes 'a' and 'b', and hopes
for the best.

So my current choice is to make SpecConstr similarly aggressive, and
ignore the bad potential of reboxing.


Note [Good arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So we look for

* A self-recursive function.  Ignore mutual recursion for now, 
  because it's less common, and the code is simpler for self-recursion.

* EITHER

   a) At a recursive call, one or more parameters is an explicit 
      constructor application
	AND
      That same parameter is scrutinised by a case somewhere in 
      the RHS of the function

  OR

    b) At a recursive call, one or more parameters has an unfolding
       that is an explicit constructor application
	AND
      That same parameter is scrutinised by a case somewhere in 
      the RHS of the function
	AND
      Those are the only uses of the parameter (see Note [Reboxing])


What to abstract over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a bit of a complication with type arguments.  If the call
site looks like

	f p = ...f ((:) [a] x xs)...

then our specialised function look like

	f_spec x xs = let p = (:) [a] x xs in ....as before....

This only makes sense if either
  a) the type variable 'a' is in scope at the top of f, or
  b) the type variable 'a' is an argument to f (and hence fs)

Actually, (a) may hold for value arguments too, in which case
we may not want to pass them.  Supose 'x' is in scope at f's
defn, but xs is not.  Then we'd like

	f_spec xs = let p = (:) [a] x xs in ....as before....

Similarly (b) may hold too.  If x is already an argument at the
call, no need to pass it again.

Finally, if 'a' is not in scope at the call site, we could abstract
it as we do the term variables:

	f_spec a x xs = let p = (:) [a] x xs in ...as before...

So the grand plan is:

	* abstract the call site to a constructor-only pattern
	  e.g.  C x (D (f p) (g q))  ==>  C s1 (D s2 s3)

	* Find the free variables of the abstracted pattern

	* Pass these variables, less any that are in scope at
	  the fn defn.  But see Note [Shadowing] below.


NOTICE that we only abstract over variables that are not in scope,
so we're in no danger of shadowing variables used in "higher up"
in f_spec's RHS.


Note [Shadowing]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this pass we gather up usage information that may mention variables
that are bound between the usage site and the definition site; or (more
seriously) may be bound to something different at the definition site.
For example:

	f x = letrec g y v = let x = ... 
			     in ...(g (a,b) x)...

Since 'x' is in scope at the call site, we may make a rewrite rule that 
looks like
	RULE forall a,b. g (a,b) x = ...
But this rule will never match, because it's really a different 'x' at 
the call site -- and that difference will be manifest by the time the
simplifier gets to it.  [A worry: the simplifier doesn't *guarantee*
no-shadowing, so perhaps it may not be distinct?]

Anyway, the rule isn't actually wrong, it's just not useful.  One possibility
is to run deShadowBinds before running SpecConstr, but instead we run the
simplifier.  That gives the simplest possible program for SpecConstr to
chew on; and it virtually guarantees no shadowing.

Note [Specialising for constant parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This one is about specialising on a *constant* (but not necessarily
constructor) argument

    foo :: Int -> (Int -> Int) -> Int
    foo 0 f = 0
    foo m f = foo (f m) (+1)

It produces

    lvl_rmV :: GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Base.Int
    lvl_rmV =
      \ (ds_dlk :: GHC.Base.Int) ->
        case ds_dlk of wild_alH { GHC.Base.I# x_alG ->
        GHC.Base.I# (GHC.Prim.+# x_alG 1)

    T.$wfoo :: GHC.Prim.Int# -> (GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Base.Int) ->
    GHC.Prim.Int#
    T.$wfoo =
      \ (ww_sme :: GHC.Prim.Int#) (w_smg :: GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Base.Int) ->
        case ww_sme of ds_Xlw {
          __DEFAULT ->
    	case w_smg (GHC.Base.I# ds_Xlw) of w1_Xmo { GHC.Base.I# ww1_Xmz ->
    	T.$wfoo ww1_Xmz lvl_rmV
    	};
          0 -> 0
        }

The recursive call has lvl_rmV as its argument, so we could create a specialised copy
with that argument baked in; that is, not passed at all.   Now it can perhaps be inlined.

When is this worth it?  Call the constant 'lvl'
- If 'lvl' has an unfolding that is a constructor, see if the corresponding
  parameter is scrutinised anywhere in the body.

- If 'lvl' has an unfolding that is a inlinable function, see if the corresponding
  parameter is applied (...to enough arguments...?)

  Also do this is if the function has RULES?

Also 	

Note [Specialising for lambda parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    foo :: Int -> (Int -> Int) -> Int
    foo 0 f = 0
    foo m f = foo (f m) (\n -> n-m)

This is subtly different from the previous one in that we get an
explicit lambda as the argument:

    T.$wfoo :: GHC.Prim.Int# -> (GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Base.Int) ->
    GHC.Prim.Int#
    T.$wfoo =
      \ (ww_sm8 :: GHC.Prim.Int#) (w_sma :: GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Base.Int) ->
        case ww_sm8 of ds_Xlr {
          __DEFAULT ->
    	case w_sma (GHC.Base.I# ds_Xlr) of w1_Xmf { GHC.Base.I# ww1_Xmq ->
    	T.$wfoo
    	  ww1_Xmq
    	  (\ (n_ad3 :: GHC.Base.Int) ->
    	     case n_ad3 of wild_alB { GHC.Base.I# x_alA ->
    	     GHC.Base.I# (GHC.Prim.-# x_alA ds_Xlr)
    	     })
    	};
          0 -> 0
        }

I wonder if SpecConstr couldn't be extended to handle this? After all,
lambda is a sort of constructor for functions and perhaps it already
has most of the necessary machinery?

Furthermore, there's an immediate win, because you don't need to allocate the lamda
at the call site; and if perchance it's called in the recursive call, then you
may avoid allocating it altogether.  Just like for constructors.

Looks cool, but probably rare...but it might be easy to implement.


Note [SpecConstr for casts]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider 
    data family T a :: *
    data instance T Int = T Int

    foo n = ...
       where
         go (T 0) = 0
         go (T n) = go (T (n-1))

The recursive call ends up looking like 
	go (T (I# ...) `cast` g)
So we want to spot the construtor application inside the cast.
That's why we have the Cast case in argToPat


-----------------------------------------------------
		Stuff not yet handled
-----------------------------------------------------

Here are notes arising from Roman's work that I don't want to lose.

Example 1
~~~~~~~~~
    data T a = T !a

    foo :: Int -> T Int -> Int
    foo 0 t = 0
    foo x t | even x    = case t of { T n -> foo (x-n) t }
            | otherwise = foo (x-1) t

SpecConstr does no specialisation, because the second recursive call
looks like a boxed use of the argument.  A pity.

    $wfoo_sFw :: GHC.Prim.Int# -> T.T GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Prim.Int#
    $wfoo_sFw =
      \ (ww_sFo [Just L] :: GHC.Prim.Int#) (w_sFq [Just L] :: T.T GHC.Base.Int) ->
    	 case ww_sFo of ds_Xw6 [Just L] {
    	   __DEFAULT ->
    		case GHC.Prim.remInt# ds_Xw6 2 of wild1_aEF [Dead Just A] {
    		  __DEFAULT -> $wfoo_sFw (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xw6 1) w_sFq;
    		  0 ->
    		    case w_sFq of wild_Xy [Just L] { T.T n_ad5 [Just U(L)] ->
    		    case n_ad5 of wild1_aET [Just A] { GHC.Base.I# y_aES [Just L] ->
    		    $wfoo_sFw (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xw6 y_aES) wild_Xy
    		    } } };
    	   0 -> 0

Example 2
~~~~~~~~~
    data a :*: b = !a :*: !b
    data T a = T !a

    foo :: (Int :*: T Int) -> Int
    foo (0 :*: t) = 0
    foo (x :*: t) | even x    = case t of { T n -> foo ((x-n) :*: t) }
                  | otherwise = foo ((x-1) :*: t)

Very similar to the previous one, except that the parameters are now in
a strict tuple. Before SpecConstr, we have

    $wfoo_sG3 :: GHC.Prim.Int# -> T.T GHC.Base.Int -> GHC.Prim.Int#
    $wfoo_sG3 =
      \ (ww_sFU [Just L] :: GHC.Prim.Int#) (ww_sFW [Just L] :: T.T
    GHC.Base.Int) ->
        case ww_sFU of ds_Xws [Just L] {
          __DEFAULT ->
    	case GHC.Prim.remInt# ds_Xws 2 of wild1_aEZ [Dead Just A] {
    	  __DEFAULT ->
    	    case ww_sFW of tpl_B2 [Just L] { T.T a_sFo [Just A] ->
    	    $wfoo_sG3 (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xws 1) tpl_B2		-- $wfoo1
    	    };
    	  0 ->
    	    case ww_sFW of wild_XB [Just A] { T.T n_ad7 [Just S(L)] ->
    	    case n_ad7 of wild1_aFd [Just L] { GHC.Base.I# y_aFc [Just L] ->
    	    $wfoo_sG3 (GHC.Prim.-# ds_Xws y_aFc) wild_XB	-- $wfoo2
    	    } } };
          0 -> 0 }

We get two specialisations:
"SC:$wfoo1" [0] __forall {a_sFB :: GHC.Base.Int sc_sGC :: GHC.Prim.Int#}
		  Foo.$wfoo sc_sGC (Foo.T @ GHC.Base.Int a_sFB)
		  = Foo.$s$wfoo1 a_sFB sc_sGC ;
"SC:$wfoo2" [0] __forall {y_aFp :: GHC.Prim.Int# sc_sGC :: GHC.Prim.Int#}
		  Foo.$wfoo sc_sGC (Foo.T @ GHC.Base.Int (GHC.Base.I# y_aFp))
		  = Foo.$s$wfoo y_aFp sc_sGC ;

But perhaps the first one isn't good.  After all, we know that tpl_B2 is
a T (I# x) really, because T is strict and Int has one constructor.  (We can't
unbox the strict fields, becuase T is polymorphic!)

\subsection{The main recursive function}

%************************************************************************

The main recursive function gathers up usage information, and
creates specialised versions of functions.

\begin{code}
scExpr :: ScEnv -> CoreExpr -> UniqSM (ScUsage, CoreExpr)
	-- The unique supply is needed when we invent
	-- a new name for the specialised function and its args

scExpr env e@(Type t) = returnUs (nullUsage, e)
