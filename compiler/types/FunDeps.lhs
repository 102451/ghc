FunDeps - functional dependencies

It's better to read it as: "if we know these, then we're going to know these"

\begin{code}
module FunDeps (
 	Equation, pprEquation,
	oclose, grow, improveOne,
	checkInstCoverage, checkFunDeps,
	pprFundeps
    ) where

#include "HsVersions.h"

import Name
import Var
import Class
import TcGadt
import TcType
import InstEnv
import VarSet
import VarEnv
import Outputable
import Util
import Data.Maybe	( isJust )

\subsection{Close type variables}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

(oclose preds tvs) closes the set of type variables tvs, 
wrt functional dependencies in preds.  The result is a superset
of the argument set.  For example, if we have
	class C a b | a->b where ...
then
	oclose [C (x,y) z, C (x,p) q] {x,y} = {x,y,z}
because if we know x and y then that fixes z.

Using oclose
~~~~~~~~~~~~
oclose is used

a) When determining ambiguity.  The type
	forall a,b. C a b => a
is not ambiguous (given the above class decl for C) because
a determines b.  

b) When generalising a type T.  Usually we take FV(T) \ FV(Env),
but in fact we need
	FV(T) \ (FV(Env)+)
where the '+' is the oclosure operation.  Notice that we do not 
take FV(T)+.  This puzzled me for a bit.  Consider

	f = E

and suppose e have that E :: C a b => a, and suppose that b is
free in the environment. Then we quantify over 'a' only, giving
the type forall a. C a b => a.  Since a->b but we don't have b->a,
we might have instance decls like
	instance C Bool Int where ...
	instance C Char Int where ...
so knowing that b=Int doesn't fix 'a'; so we quantify over it.

		---------------
		A WORRY: ToDo!
		---------------
If we have	class C a b => D a b where ....
     		class D a b | a -> b where ...
and the preds are [C (x,y) z], then we want to see the fd in D,
even though it is not explicit in C, giving [({x,y},{z})]

Similarly for instance decls?  E.g. Suppose we have
	instance C a b => Eq (T a b) where ...
and we infer a type t with constraints Eq (T a b) for a particular
expression, and suppose that 'a' is free in the environment.  
We could generalise to
	forall b. Eq (T a b) => t
but if we reduced the constraint, to C a b, we'd see that 'a' determines
b, so that a better type might be
	t (with free constraint C a b) 
Perhaps it doesn't matter, because we'll still force b to be a
particular type at the call sites.  Generalising over too many
variables (provided we don't shadow anything by quantifying over a
variable that is actually free in the envt) may postpone errors; it
won't hide them altogether.


\begin{code}
oclose :: [PredType] -> TyVarSet -> TyVarSet
oclose preds fixed_tvs
  | null tv_fds = fixed_tvs	-- Fast escape hatch for common case
  | otherwise   = loop fixed_tvs
  where
    loop fixed_tvs
	| new_fixed_tvs `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs
	| otherwise		  	      = loop new_fixed_tvs
	where
	  new_fixed_tvs = foldl extend fixed_tvs tv_fds

    extend fixed_tvs (ls,rs) | ls `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs `unionVarSet` rs
			     | otherwise		= fixed_tvs

    tv_fds  :: [(TyVarSet,TyVarSet)]
	-- In our example, tv_fds will be [ ({x,y}, {z}), ({x,p},{q}) ]
	-- Meaning "knowing x,y fixes z, knowing x,p fixes q"
    tv_fds  = [ (tyVarsOfTypes xs, tyVarsOfTypes ys)
	      | ClassP cls tys <- preds,		-- Ignore implicit params
		let (cls_tvs, cls_fds) = classTvsFds cls,
		fd <- cls_fds,
		let (xs,ys) = instFD fd cls_tvs tys
	      ]
\end{code}

Note [Growing the tau-tvs using constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(grow preds tvs) is the result of extend the set of tyvars tvs
		 using all conceivable links from pred

E.g. tvs = {a}, preds = {H [a] b, K (b,Int) c, Eq e}
Then grow precs tvs = {a,b,c}

All the type variables from an implicit parameter are added, whether or
not they are mentioned in tvs; see Note [Implicit parameters and ambiguity] 
in TcSimplify.

See also Note [Ambiguity] in TcSimplify

\begin{code}
grow :: [PredType] -> TyVarSet -> TyVarSet
grow preds fixed_tvs 
  | null preds = real_fixed_tvs
  | otherwise  = loop real_fixed_tvs
  where
	-- Add the implicit parameters; 
	-- see Note [Implicit parameters and ambiguity] in TcSimplify
    real_fixed_tvs = foldr unionVarSet fixed_tvs ip_tvs
 
    loop fixed_tvs
	| new_fixed_tvs `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs
	| otherwise		  	      = loop new_fixed_tvs
	where
	  new_fixed_tvs = foldl extend fixed_tvs non_ip_tvs

    extend fixed_tvs pred_tvs 
	| fixed_tvs `intersectsVarSet` pred_tvs = fixed_tvs `unionVarSet` pred_tvs
	| otherwise			        = fixed_tvs

    (ip_tvs, non_ip_tvs) = partitionWith get_ip preds
    get_ip (IParam _ ty) = Left (tyVarsOfType ty)
    get_ip other         = Right (tyVarsOfPred other)

\subsection{Generate equations from functional dependencies}
%*									*
%************************************************************************


\begin{code}
type Equation = (TyVarSet, [(Type, Type)])
-- These pairs of types should be equal, for some
-- substitution of the tyvars in the tyvar set
-- INVARIANT: corresponding types aren't already equal

-- It's important that we have a *list* of pairs of types.  Consider
-- 	class C a b c | a -> b c where ...
--	instance C Int x x where ...
-- Then, given the constraint (C Int Bool v) we should improve v to Bool,
-- via the equation ({x}, [(Bool,x), (v,x)])
-- This would not happen if the class had looked like
--	class C a b c | a -> b, a -> c

-- To "execute" the equation, make fresh type variable for each tyvar in the set,
-- instantiate the two types with these fresh variables, and then unify.
--
-- For example, ({a,b}, (a,Int,b), (Int,z,Bool))
-- We unify z with Int, but since a and b are quantified we do nothing to them
-- We usually act on an equation by instantiating the quantified type varaibles
-- to fresh type variables, and then calling the standard unifier.

pprEquation (qtvs, pairs) 
  = vcat [ptext SLIT("forall") <+> braces (pprWithCommas ppr (varSetElems qtvs)),
	  nest 2 (vcat [ ppr t1 <+> ptext SLIT(":=:") <+> ppr t2 | (t1,t2) <- pairs])]
\end{code}

Given a bunch of predicates that must hold, such as

	C Int t1, C Int t2, C Bool t3, ?x::t4, ?x::t5

improve figures out what extra equations must hold.
For example, if we have

	class C a b | a->b where ...

then improve will return

	[(t1,t2), (t4,t5)]

NOTA BENE:

  * improve does not iterate.  It's possible that when we make
    t1=t2, for example, that will in turn trigger a new equation.
    This would happen if we also had
	C t1 t7, C t2 t8
    If t1=t2, we also get t7=t8.

    improve does *not* do this extra step.  It relies on the caller
    doing so.

  * The equations unify types that are not already equal.  So there
    is no effect iff the result of improve is empty

\end{code}

Note [Coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the coverage condition, we used to require only that 
	fv(t2) `subset` oclose(fv(t1), theta)

Example:
	class Mul a b c | a b -> c where
		(.*.) :: a -> b -> c

	instance Mul Int Int Int where (.*.) = (*)
	instance Mul Int Float Float where x .*. y = fromIntegral x * y
	instance Mul a b c => Mul a [b] [c] where x .*. v = map (x.*.) v

In the third instance, it's not the case that fv([c]) `subset` fv(a,[b]).
But it is the case that fv([c]) `subset` oclose( theta, fv(a,[b]) )

But it is a mistake to accept the instance because then this defn:
	f = \ b x y -> if b then x .*. [y] else y
makes instance inference go into a loop, because it requires the constraint
	Mul a [b] b


%************************************************************************
%*									*
	Check that a new instance decl is OK wrt fundeps
%*									*
%************************************************************************

Here is the bad case:
	class C a b | a->b where ...
	instance C Int Bool where ...
	instance C Int Char where ...

The point is that a->b, so Int in the first parameter must uniquely
determine the second.  In general, given the same class decl, and given

	instance C s1 s2 where ...
	instance C t1 t2 where ...

Then the criterion is: if U=unify(s1,t1) then U(s2) = U(t2).

Matters are a little more complicated if there are free variables in
the s2/t2.  

	class D a b c | a -> b
	instance D a b => D [(a,a)] [b] Int
	instance D a b => D [a]     [b] Bool

The instance decls don't overlap, because the third parameter keeps
them separate.  But we want to make sure that given any constraint
	D s1 s2 s3
if s1 matches
