\begin{code}
type DFunId = Id
data Instance 
  = Instance { is_cls  :: Name		-- Class name
	
		-- Used for "rough matching"; see note below
	     , is_tcs  :: [Maybe Name]	-- Top of type args

		-- Used for "proper matching"; see note
	     , is_tvs  :: TyVarSet	-- Template tyvars for full match
	     , is_tys  :: [Type]	-- Full arg types

	     , is_dfun :: DFunId
	     , is_flag :: OverlapFlag	-- See detailed comments with
					-- the decl of BasicTypes.OverlapFlag

	     , is_orph :: Maybe OccName }

-- The "rough-match" fields
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- The is_cls, is_args fields allow a "rough match" to be done
-- without poking inside the DFunId.  Poking the DFunId forces
-- us to suck in all the type constructors etc it involves,
-- which is a total waste of time if it has no chance of matching
-- So the Name, [Maybe Name] fields allow us to say "definitely
-- does not match", based only on the Name.
--
-- In is_tcs, 
--     Nothing  means that this type arg is a type variable
--
--     (Just n) means that this type arg is a
-- 		TyConApp with a type constructor of n.
--		This is always a real tycon, never a synonym!
--		(Two different synonyms might match, but two
--		different real tycons can't.)
--		NB: newtypes are not transparent, though!
--
-- The "proper-match" fields
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- The is_tvs, is_tys fields are simply cahced values, pulled
-- out (lazily) from the dfun id. They are cached here simply so 
-- that we don't need to decompose the DFunId each time we want 
-- to match it.  The hope is that the fast-match fields mean
-- that we often never poke th proper-match fields
--
-- However, note that:
--  * is_tvs must be a superset of the free vars of is_tys
--
--  * The is_dfun must itself be quantified over exactly is_tvs
--    (This is so that we can use the matching substitution to
--     instantiate the dfun's context.)
--
-- The "orphan" field
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- An instance is an orphan if its head (after the =>) mentions
-- nothing defined in this module.  
--
--    Just n	The head mentions n, which is defined in this module
--		This is used for versioning; the instance decl is
--		considered part of the defn of n when computing versions
--
--    Nothing 	The head mentions nothing defined in this module
--
-- If a module contains any orphans, then its interface file is read 
-- regardless, so that its instances are not missed. 
-- 
-- Functional dependencies worsen the situation a bit. Consider
--	class C a b | a -> b
-- In some other module we might have
--    module M where
--	data T = ...
--	instance C Int T where ...
-- This isn't considered an orphan, so we will only read M's interface
-- if something from M is used (e.g. T).  So there's a risk we'll
-- miss the improvement from the instance.  Workaround: import M.

Note [Overlapping instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overlap is permitted, but only in such a way that one can make
a unique choice when looking up.  That is, overlap is only permitted if
one template matches the other, or vice versa.  So this is ok:

  [a]  [Int]

but this is not

  (Int,a)  (b,Int)

If overlap is permitted, the list is kept most specific first, so that
the first lookup is the right choice.


For now we just use association lists.

\subsection{Avoiding a problem with overlapping}

Consider this little program:

\begin{pseudocode}
     class C a        where c :: a
     class C a => D a where d :: a

     instance C Int where c = 17
     instance D Int where d = 13

     instance C a => C [a] where c = [c]
     instance ({- C [a], -} D a) => D [a] where d = c

     instance C [Int] where c = [37]

     main = print (d :: [Int])
\end{pseudocode}

What do you think `main' prints  (assuming we have overlapping instances, and
all that turned on)?  Well, the instance for `D' at type `[a]' is defined to
be `c' at the same type, and we've got an instance of `C' at `[Int]', so the
answer is `[37]', right? (the generic `C [a]' instance shouldn't apply because
the `C [Int]' instance is more specific).

Ghc-4.04 gives `[37]', while ghc-4.06 gives `[17]', so 4.06 is wrong.  That
was easy ;-)  Let's just consult hugs for good measure.  Wait - if I use old
hugs (pre-September99), I get `[17]', and stranger yet, if I use hugs98, it
doesn't even compile!  What's going on!?

What hugs complains about is the `D [a]' instance decl.

\begin{pseudocode}
     ERROR "mj.hs" (line 10): Cannot build superclass instance
     *** Instance            : D [a]
     *** Context supplied    : D a
     *** Required superclass : C [a]
\end{pseudocode}

You might wonder what hugs is complaining about.  It's saying that you
need to add `C [a]' to the context of the `D [a]' instance (as appears
in comments).  But there's that `C [a]' instance decl one line above
that says that I can reduce the need for a `C [a]' instance to the
need for a `C a' instance, and in this case, I already have the
necessary `C a' instance (since we have `D a' explicitly in the
context, and `C' is a superclass of `D').

Unfortunately, the above reasoning indicates a premature commitment to the
generic `C [a]' instance.  I.e., it prematurely rules out the more specific
instance `C [Int]'.  This is the mistake that ghc-4.06 makes.  The fix is to
add the context that hugs suggests (uncomment the `C [a]'), effectively
deferring the decision about which instance to use.

Now, interestingly enough, 4.04 has this same bug, but it's covered up
in this case by a little known `optimization' that was disabled in
4.06.  Ghc-4.04 silently inserts any missing superclass context into
an instance declaration.  In this case, it silently inserts the `C
[a]', and everything happens to work out.

(See `basicTypes/MkId:mkDictFunId' for the code in question.  Search for
`Mark Jones', although Mark claims no credit for the `optimization' in
question, and would rather it stopped being called the `Mark Jones
optimization' ;-)

So, what's the fix?  I think hugs has it right.  Here's why.  Let's try
something else out with ghc-4.04.  Let's add the following line:

    d' :: D a => [a]
    d' = c

Everyone raise their hand who thinks that `d :: [Int]' should give a
different answer from `d' :: [Int]'.  Well, in ghc-4.04, it does.  The
`optimization' only applies to instance decls, not to regular
bindings, giving inconsistent behavior.

Old hugs had this same bug.  Here's how we fixed it: like GHC, the
list of instances for a given class is ordered, so that more specific
instances come before more generic ones.  For example, the instance
list for C might contain:
    ..., C Int, ..., C a, ...  
When we go to look for a `C Int' instance we'll get that one first.
But what if we go looking for a `C b' (`b' is unconstrained)?  We'll
pass the `C Int' instance, and keep going.  But if `b' is
unconstrained, then we don't know yet if the more specific instance
will eventually apply.  GHC keeps going, and matches on the generic `C
a'.  The fix is to, at each step, check to see if there's a reverse
match, and if so, abort the search.  This prevents hugs from
prematurely chosing a generic instance when a more specific one
exists.

--Jeff

BUT NOTE [Nov 2001]: we must actually *unify* not reverse-match in
this test.  Suppose the instance envt had
    ..., forall a b. C a a b, ..., forall a b c. C a b c, ...
(still most specific first)
Now suppose we are looking for (C x y Int), where x and y are unconstrained.
	C x y Int  doesn't match the template {a,b} C a a b
but neither does 
	C a a b  match the template {x,y} C x y Int
But still x and y might subsequently be unified so they *do* match.

Simple story: unify, don't match.

A @ClsInstEnv@ all the instances of that class.  The @Id@ inside a
ClsInstEnv mapping is the dfun for that instance.

If class C maps to a list containing the item ([a,b], [t1,t2,t3], dfun), then

	forall a b, C t1 t2 t3  can be constructed by dfun

or, to put it another way, we have

	instance (...) => C t1 t2 t3,  witnessed by dfun

			--	(C a b c) can fail immediately

-- INVARIANTS:
--  * The is_tvs are distinct in each Instance
--	of a ClsInstEnv (so we can safely unify them)

-- Thus, the @ClassInstEnv@ for @Eq@ might contain the following entry:
