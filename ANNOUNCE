	     The Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 2.07
	    ==============================================

We are pleased to announce a new release of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC), version 2.07. Source distribution is freely available
via the World-Wide Web and through anon. FTP; details below.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language; the
current language version is 1.4, agreed in April, 1997.  Haskell
related information is available from the Haskell home page at

	http://haskell.org/

+ What's new
=============

Release 2.07 is a bug-fix release.  It addresses all of the
bootstrapping/building/installation problems in 2.06.

+ Mailing lists
================

We run mailing lists for GHC users and bug reports; to subscribe, send
mail to majordomo@dcs.gla.ac.uk; the msg body should be:

    subscribe glasgow-haskell-<which> Your Name <your-email@where.you.are>

Please send bug reports about GHC to glasgow-haskell-bugs@dcs.gla.ac.uk ; GHC
users hang out on glasgow-haskell-users@dcs.gla.ac.uk


+ On-line GHC-related resources
================================

Relevant URLs on the World-Wide Web:

GHC home page    	  http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/
Haskell home page	  http://haskell.org/
Glasgow FP group page     http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/
comp.lang.functional FAQ  http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Staff/mpj/faq.html


+ How to get it
================

The easy way is to go to the WWW GHC distribution page, which should
be self-explanatory:

	ftp://ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pub/haskell/glasgow/README.html

Once you have the distribution, please follow the pointers in the
README file to find all of the documentation about this release.  NB:
preserve modification times when un-tarring the files (no `m' option
for tar, please)!


+ System requirements
======================

To compile up this source-only release, you need a machine with 16+MB
memory, GNU C (`gcc'), `perl' plus a version of GHC installed (either
version 0.29 or 2.02 onwards). We have seen GHC work on these platforms:

  * alpha-dec-osf2
  * hppa1.1-hp-hpux{9,10}
  * sparc-sun-{sunos4,solaris2}
  * mips-sgi-irix{5,6}
  * i386-unknown-{linux,solaris2,freebsd,cygwin32}.
  * {rs6000,powerpc}-ibm-aix

Similar platforms should work with minimal hacking effort.  The installer's
guide included in distribution gives a complete run-down of what-ports-work;
an on-line version can be found at
