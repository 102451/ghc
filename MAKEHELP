Using the GHC build system
--------------------------

For a "Getting Started" guide, see:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Hacking

Common commands:

  make

     Builds everything: ghc stages 1 and 2, all libraries and tools.

  make -j2

     Parallel build: runs up to 2 commands at a time (use the number of
     CPUs in your machine in place of '2')

  cd <dir>; make

     Builds everything in the given directory.

  cd compiler; make 2

     Make just the stage2 compiler, ignoring dependencies.  Also "make 1" to
     build just the stage1 compiler.

  cd libraries; make 1

     Build just those libraries that are built by stage1 (omit the "1" to build
     all libraries, but that will also update the stage2 compiler).

  make install

     Installs GHC, libraries and tools under $(prefix)

  make sdist
  make binary-dist

     Builds a source or binary distribution respectively

  make show VALUE=<var>

     Displays the value of make variable <var>

  make clean
  make distclean
  make maintainer-clean

     Various levels of cleaning: "clean" restores the tree to the
     state after "./configure", "distclean" restores to the state
     after "sh boot", and maintainer-clean restores the tree to the
     completely clean checked-out state.
