#
#	This file defines all the variables that set the configuration of
#	a particular build.
#
#
################################################################################

# The configuration is defined in two steps:
#
#	1. The builder (i.e. the person doing the build)
#	   copies this file, config.mk.in-template
#	   to config.mk.in
#
#	2. S/he then edits it manually (gasp) to reflect any configuration
#	   options s/he wants.
#
#	3. Then s/he runs "configure", which generates config.mk from
#	   config.mk.in, substituting for system/platform-dependent things
#	   enclosed in @at-signs@.
#
# This is one of only two files that configure generates (the other is config.h)
#
# Note that after subsequent edits of config.mk.in for a build, the configure script
# will have to be re-run manually to have the change reflected in config.mk. 
#

# There is a section below for each project within the fptools suite
#
#	PLUS
#
# a section corresponding to each of the main .mk files 
# included by boilerplate.mk (see boilerplate.mk for a list).

# Options for the compiling different `ways'. Various projects within
# the glorious fptools tree support building in various user-configured
# ways. For instance, you could set up one `way' such that the prelude
# libraries all were built with the option -ffoldr-build-on.
# 
# To configure up your own way, have a look at some of the standard ways
# such as profiling, and create your own set of WAY_*_OPTS defs below.
# After having done that, add your way string to WAYS, and after having
# run the configure script, the different projects will add the new way
# to the list of ways they support.
#

#
# IMPORTANT! The WAYS variable configures the different `ways'
# you want to build a project (or maybe just parts of it, as is
# the case for ghc/). This variable is intended set inside the
# project mk setup, enforcing a global fptools WAYS is a bit too
# much (do you *really* want to build glafp-utils the profiled-concurrent 
# way?)
#

#
# Definitions of the different ways:
#   
#   * their name:
#          - tag, e.g., p
#          - description, e.g., profiling
#   * what they mean to the driver:
#          - WAY_p_HC_OPTS gives the list of command-line options
#            to the driver.
#

#
# The ways currently defined.
#
ALL_WAYS=p t u s mp mg a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o A B
USER_WAYS=a b c d e f g h j k l m n o A B

#
# The following ways currently have treated specially, p u t mg,
# as the driver script treats these guys specially and needs to carefully be told
# about the options for these. Hence, we hide the required command line options
# for these in the ghc/driver, as this is the only place they are needed.
