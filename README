GHC build system
================

This is the top-level directory of the fptools build system.  Several
packages are part of this build system; if you got this as part of a
source distribution (eg. for GHC), then you will have one or more of
the following directories:

    ghc		  The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
    hslibs	  A Collection of Haskell libraries
    haddock	  A Haskell documentation tool
    haggis	  The Haggis GUI toolkit
    happy	  The Happy Haskell parser generator
    hdirect       Haskell interop tool
    greencard	  A foreign function interface pre-processor for Haskell.
    libraries	  Haskell libraries (reqd. by ghc)
    nofib	  The NoFib Haskell benchmarking suite

Additional documentation for each project can be found in its
respective directory.

In addition, the following directories contain project-independent bits:

    mk	          GNU make setup used by all of fptools
    glafp-utils   Shared utility programs
    docs          Documentation on the installing and using
                  the fptools build system.
    distrib	  Tools and additional bits for building distributions

Quick start:  the following is *supposed* to work

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

where 'make' is whatever GNU make is called on your system (GNU make
is *required*).  If there are any other tools required for the build,
then the configure script will detect them and tell you if any are
missing.  For example, a working GHC installation is required for
building most of the tools (including GHC itself).

The configuration script is a standard GNU autoconf script which
accepts all the normal arguments, eg. --prefix=<blah> to install the
package somewhere other than /usr/local.  Try ./configure --help to
get a full list of the options.

There is usually an ANNOUNCE* file with any distribution.  Please
consult that, or the <piece>/README file, to find out how to proceed.
