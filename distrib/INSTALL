The short story (if you are installing GHC from a binary dist):

- Decide where you want to install it.
- Do    ./configure --prefix=where-i-want-to-install-it
- Do    make install

That installs everything - the compiler, interactive system,
libraries, and documentation.  At the end of 'make install' you will
be informed of what you need to add to your PATH, and also the
location of the documentation.

Linux users: GHCi-5.00 needs libreadline.so.3.  Newer Linuxes (SuSE
7.1, possibly RH 7.X, possibly Mandrake 8.X) only come with
libreadline.so.4.  If you need libreadline.so.3 and only have the .4
version, you might be able to get things working by making a symbolic
link from libreadline.so.4 to libreadline.so.3.  We tried this on a
SuSE 7.1 box and it seemed to work.

The Long Story

This is the INSTALL instructions for a binary distribution of one of
the fptools projects. For more details on what on earth this package
is up to, please consult the README and ANNOUNCE.

To start using the bundle, you can either:

* use it in-place, i.e., don't go ahead with a
  full install, but just set it up to use the unpacked
  distribution in-situ.

* get it over with, and do the full install (details of how are ahead).

NOTE Win32 users: see comment below before continuing.

To set the ball rolling, run the configure script (as usual, run
the script with --help to see what options it supports).

This will figure out what platform you're running on, and a couple of other
interesting pieces of trivia, which it will then fill in the Makefile.in
template to give you a real Makefile. 

[Win32 users: don't be alarmed if you should encounter the following
 message from the configure script:
  
      not updating unwritable cache ./config.cache

This is a known problem of generated autoconf configure scripts running
on cygwin, but harmless (it only means you get to re-do all the configure
tests should you decide to re-run the script.)
]

Have a look at the Makefile to see if you agree with the information
therein. If you want to use the bundle in-place, now run:

	make in-place

If you're installing,  run

	make install 

(`make show-install-setup' prints the details of where the different
pieces of the bundle are heading when -- possibly helpful).

Bug reports/suggestions for improvement to the installation procedure/setup
(as well as other GHC related troubles you're experiencing, of course),
gratefully received at glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org

Enjoy.
