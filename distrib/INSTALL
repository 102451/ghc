This is the INSTALL instructions for a binary bundle of the
Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System. For more details
on what on earth this package is up to, please consult the README
and ANNOUNCE.

To start using the bundle, you can either:

* use it in-place, i.e., don't go ahead with a
  full install, but just set it up to use the unpacked
  distribution from where it was unpacked.

* get it over with, and do the full install (details of how are ahead).

NOTE Win32 users: see comment below before continuing.

To set the ball rolling, run the configure script (as usual, run
the script with --help to see what options it supports).

This will figure out what platform you're running on, and a couple of other
interesting pieces of trivia, which it will then fill in the Makefile.in
template to give you a real Makefile.

Have a look at the Makefile to see if you agree with the information
therein. If you want to use the bundle in-place, now run `make in-place'.
If you're installing, `make install' (`make show-install-setup' prints
the details of where the different pieces of the bundle are heading when
-- possibly helpful).

For more information, please consult the installation guide in
{html,dvi,info}/ghc-2.02/installing{.dvi,.info,_toc.html}.

Bug reports/suggestions for improvement to the installation procedure/setup
(as well as other GHC related troubles you're experiencing, of course),
gratefully received at glasgow-haskell-bugs@dcs.gla.ac.uk

Enjoy.


-------Win32 users only----------------------------------------
NOTE to Win32 users: to enjoy any sort of happiness with the GHC
tools, you will have to install the cygwin32 toolchain, which dresses
up the Win32 environment into something more UNIX-like (which
this initial port of ghc relies on being the case). The cygwin32 tools
are available from

    ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/gnu-win32-b17.1/   
       (Cygnus Solutions; Mt. View, CA.)
    ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/gnu/cygnus/gnu-win32/
        (Sunsite Northern Europe; Imperial College, London)
    ftp://ftp.crl.go.jp/pub/GNU/cygnus/gnu-win32/
	(CRL, Ministry of Posts and Telecom., Japan)

GHC was built with beta17 - you *might* get away with beta16 if you've already got it
installed...not tested this though.

The GHC tools are also quite picky about Perl, the commonly-used
Hip/ActiveWare Win32 port of perl5 just ain't Cool Enough (main reason: 
GHC scripts assume they are talking to an underlying UNIX command
shell). A port of perl5.003 done on top of cygwin32-b17 is just
the ticket though, it is available from 

   http://www.edv.agrar.tu-muenchen.de/~syring/gnu-win32/

this port is not complete - but the binaries available from there
are sufficiently wonderful.

Install both cygwin32&perl5 before continuing.

Future releases of GHC for Win32 may very well avoid relying on
cygwin32 to operate, for various reasons..
