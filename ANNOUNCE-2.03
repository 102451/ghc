	     The Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 2.03
	     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are pleased to announce the Glasgow Haskell Compiler version 2.03.  

GHC 2.03 is a minor upgrade of GHC 2.02.  It differs in the following
ways:

  * A slew of small bugs are fixed.  You can find the complete list
    at	http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~simonpj/ghc-bugs.html

  * Last-minute language changes have been implemented (minor changes
    to the libraries, and to module export/hiding scope rules)

  * It is only available as a source distribution.  If you want to
    use it you'll have to build it from source.  Nowadays this is
    a well-documented process (see the build & installation guide).

None of the bugs in GHC 2.02 are show-stoppers, so you'll only want
to upgrade if you are a build-from-source junkie and the bugs are 
irritating you.
