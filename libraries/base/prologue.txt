The @base@ package contains the "Prelude" and its support libraries,
and a large collection of useful libraries ranging from data
structures to parsing combinators and debugging utilities.

The @base@ package is enabled by default; to import any of the modules
listed here just import it by name.  Remember to give the /fully
qualified/ name when importing a module from the hierarchy.
