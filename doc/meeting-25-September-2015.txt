Shaking up GHC meeting, 25 September 2015

Things to discuss:
================================================

1. Better names for build stages

* Currently we have Stage0, Stage1, etc. It is not particularly clear
from the names what they stand for. We no longer need to stick to
numbers and can pick more helpful names, for example:

Stage0 -> Boot    
Stage1 -> Interim 
Stage2 -> Install 
Stage3 -> Selftest




i. Unclear abstractions Builder/BuildRule...

ii. Limits to build parallelism: GHC crashes during parallel builds. Also ghc-pkg and ghc-cabal are apparently not thread-safe, so I had to use Shake resources to limit the parallelism...


2. Do we need a name for the new build system?

* At least we need a name for the folder in the GHC tree

* If we call it 'shake' there may be a confusion with the Shake library.

* In future discussions/announcements/etc. calling it 'the new shake-based
  build system' is overly verbose. Calling it 'shake' is confusing.

* I haven't thought about any names yet, just checking whether we want to.
