1. Rebuild only when argument list has changed
2. Rebuild only when package-data.mk contents has changed

* Add to Settings/GhcPkg.hs: package deepseq ? arg "--force"

3. Reduce complexity when searching for source files by 40x:

* compiler, was: 25 dirs (24 source dirs + autogen) x 406 modules x 2 extensions = 20300 candidates
* compiler, now: 25 dirs x 20 module-dirs = 500 candidates

4. Limit parallelism of ghc-cabal & ghc-pkg

* https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-commits/2013-May/001712.html
* see ghc.mk, comment about parallel ghc-pkg invokations

5. Discovered dead & duplicated code in the old build system, e.g:

* Alex3 variable not needed as Alex 3.1 is required
* There are no generated *.y/*.ly files, hence they can never be in the build directory
* hsc2hs gets multuple "--cflag=-I$1/$2/build/autogen" flags in one invokation
* No generated Haskell files actually require copying of *.(l)hs-boot files
