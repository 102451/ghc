<H1>GHC Documentation</H1>

<P>Welcome to GHC!

<P>This is the top of the GHC documentation tree, where you will find
links to all the supplied documentation about GHC and its
libraries.</P>

<UL>
 <LI><P><B><A HREF="users_guide/users_guide.html">The User's Guide</A></B>
     <P>The User's Guide has all you need to know about using GHC:
     command line options, language extensions, GHCi, etc.

 <P>
 <LI><P><B>Hierarchical Libraries</B>

 <P>GHC comes with a large number of libraries, arranged
 hierarchically.  The libraries are divided into <EM>packages</EM> -
 to use a package of libraries from GHC or GHCi just add the flag
 <TT>-package &lt;name&gt;</TT> to the command line, where
 <TT>&lt;name&gt;</TT> is the name of the package (see the
 section on packages in the User's Guide for more information).  The
 <TT>base</TT> and <TT>haskell98</TT> packages are always available,
 so you don't need to use the <TT>-package</TT> flag to get these.

 <P>
 <LI><B><A HREF="hslibs/hslibs.html">(Old) Haskell Libraries</A></B>

 <P>Previous versions of GHC (before version 5.04) came with a suite
 of libraries known as <TT>hslibs</TT>, aka the Hugs-GHC libraries.
 As we are in the process of moving towards using hierarchical
 libraries for everything, many of these libraries have moved over to
 the new packages in the hierarchical libraries above.  We still
 provide the old <TT>hslibs</TT> libraries for backwards compatibility
 and also for those libraries which have yet to move into the
 hierarchy.  For libraries which have moved, the documentation
 contains a pointer to the location in the new libraries.
