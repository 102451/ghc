    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Glorious Driver</h1>
    <p>
      The Glorious Driver (GD) is the part of GHC that orchestrates the
      interaction of all the other pieces that make up GHC.  It supersedes the
      <em>Evil Driver (ED),</em> which was a Perl script that served the same
      purpose and was in use until version 4.08.1 of GHC.  Simon Marlow
      eventually slayed the ED and instated the GD.
    <p>
      The GD has been substantially extended for GHCi, i.e., the interactive
      variant of GHC that integrates the compiler with a (meta-circular)
      interpreter since version 5.00.
