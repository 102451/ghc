<IndexTerm><Primary>language, GHC</Primary></IndexTerm>

As with all known Haskell systems, GHC implements some extensions to
the language.  To use them, you'll need to give a <Literal>-fglasgow-exts</Literal>
<IndexTerm><Primary>-fglasgow-exts option</Primary></IndexTerm> option.
</Para>

<Para>
Virtually all of the Glasgow extensions serve to give you access to
the underlying facilities with which we implement Haskell.  Thus, you
can get at the Raw Iron, if you are willing to write some non-standard
code at a more primitive level.  You need not be ``stuck'' on
performance because of the implementation costs of Haskell's
``high-level'' features&mdash;you can always code ``under'' them.  In an
extreme case, you can write all your time-critical code in C, and then
just glue it together with Haskell!

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Unboxed types and primitive operations:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
You can get right down to the raw machine types and operations;
included in this are ``primitive arrays'' (direct access to Big Wads
of Bytes).  Please see <XRef LinkEnd="glasgow-unboxed"> and following.
</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Local universal quantification:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
GHC's type system supports explicit universal quantification in
constructor fields and function arguments.  This is useful for things
like defining <Literal>runST</Literal> from the state-thread world.  See <XRef LinkEnd="universal-quantification">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Extistentially quantification in data types:</Term>

<Para>
Some or all of the type variables in a datatype declaration may be
<Emphasis>existentially quantified</Emphasis>.  More details in <XRef LinkEnd="existential-quantification">.
</Para>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Scoped type variables:</Term>

<Para>
Scoped type variables enable the programmer to supply type signatures
for some nested declarations, where this would not be legal in Haskell
98.  Details in <XRef LinkEnd="scoped-type-variables">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Calling out to C:</Term>

<Para>
Just what it sounds like.  We provide <Emphasis>lots</Emphasis> of rope that you
can dangle around your neck.  Please see <XRef LinkEnd="glasgow-ccalls">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Pragmas</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Pragmas are special instructions to the compiler placed in the source
file.  The pragmas GHC supports are described in <XRef LinkEnd="pragmas">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Rewrite rules:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
The programmer can specify rewrite rules as part of the source program
(in a pragma).  GHC applies these rewrite rules wherever it can.
Details in <XRef LinkEnd="rewrite-rules">.

</Para>

<Para>
Before you get too carried away working at the lowest level (e.g.,
sloshing <Literal>MutableByteArray&num;</Literal>s around your program), you may wish to
check if there are system libraries that provide a ``Haskellised
veneer'' over the features you want.  See <XRef LinkEnd="ghc-prelude">.
</Para>

<Sect1 id="glasgow-unboxed">
<Title>Unboxed types
</Title>

<Para>
<IndexTerm><Primary>Unboxed types (Glasgow extension)</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
These types correspond to the ``raw machine'' types you would use in
C: <Literal>Int&num;</Literal> (long int), <Literal>Double&num;</Literal> (double), <Literal>Addr&num;</Literal> (void *), etc.  The
<Emphasis>primitive operations</Emphasis> (PrimOps) on these types are what you
might expect; e.g., <Literal>(+&num;)</Literal> is addition on <Literal>Int&num;</Literal>s, and is the
machine-addition that we all know and love&mdash;usually one instruction.
</Para>

<Para>
There are some restrictions on the use of unboxed types, the main one
being that you can't pass an unboxed value to a polymorphic function
or store one in a polymorphic data type.  This rules out things like
<Literal>[Int&num;]</Literal> (ie. lists of unboxed integers).  The reason for this
restriction is that polymorphic arguments and constructor fields are
assumed to be pointers: if an unboxed integer is stored in one of
these, the garbage collector would attempt to follow it, leading to
unpredictable space leaks.  Or a <Literal>seq</Literal> operation on the polymorphic
component may attempt to dereference the pointer, with disastrous
results.  Even worse, the unboxed value might be larger than a pointer
(<Literal>Double&num;</Literal> for instance).
</Para>

<Para>
Nevertheless, A numerically-intensive program using unboxed types can
go a <Emphasis>lot</Emphasis> faster than its ``standard'' counterpart&mdash;we saw a
threefold speedup on one example.

Second, it distinguishes between&hellip;
<VariableList>

<Term>Immutable:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Arrays that do not change (as with ``standard'' Haskell arrays); you
can only read from them.  Obviously, they do not need the care and
attention of the state-transformer monad.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Mutable:</Term>

<Term>``Static'' (in C land):</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
A C routine may pass an <Literal>Addr&num;</Literal> pointer back into Haskell land.  There
are then primitive operations with which you may merrily grab values
over in C land, by indexing off the ``static'' pointer.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``Stable'' pointers:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If, for some reason, you wish to hand a Haskell pointer (i.e.,
<Emphasis>not</Emphasis> an unboxed value) to a C routine, you first make the
pointer ``stable,'' so that the garbage collector won't forget that it
exists.  That is, GHC provides a safe way to pass Haskell pointers to
C.

<Para>
A ``foreign object'' is a safe way to pass an external object (a
C-allocated pointer, say) to Haskell and have Haskell do the Right
Thing when it no longer references the object.  So, for example, C

memory when you're done with it.''

<Para>
One of the annoyances about <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal>s is when the C types don't quite
match the Haskell compiler's ideas.  For this, the <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal> variant
may be just the ticket (NB: <Emphasis>no chance</Emphasis> of such code going
through a native-code generator):
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
The first literal-literal argument to a <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal> is like a <Literal>printf</Literal>
format: <Literal>&percnt;r</Literal> is replaced with the ``result,'' <Literal>&percnt;0</Literal>--<Literal>&percnt;n-1</Literal> are
replaced with the 1st--nth arguments.  As you can see above, it is an
easy way to do simple C&nbsp;casting.  Everything said about <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal> goes
for <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal> as well.
</Para>

<Para>
The use of <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal> in your code does pose a problem to the compiler
when it comes to generating an interface file for a freshly compiled
module. Included in an interface file is the unfolding (if any) of a
declaration. However, if a declaration's unfolding happens to contain
a <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal>, its unfolding will <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> be emitted into the interface
file even if it qualifies by all the other criteria. The reason why
the compiler prevents this from happening is that unfolding <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal>s
into an interface file unduly constrains how code that import your
module have to be compiled. If an imported declaration is unfolded and
it contains a <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal>, you now have to be using a compiler backend
capable of dealing with it (i.e., the C compiler backend). If you are
using the C compiler backend, the unfolded <Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal> may still cause you
problems since the C code snippet it contains may mention CPP symbols
that were in scope when compiling the original module are not when
compiling the importing module.
</Para>

<Para>
If you're willing to put up with the drawbacks of doing cross-module
inlining of C code (GHC - A Better C Compiler :-), the option
<Literal>-funfold-casms-in-hi-file</Literal> will turn off the default behaviour.

The arguments of a <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal> are automatically unboxed before the

 Boxed values are stored on the Haskell heap and may be moved

</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
It is possible to subvert the unboxing process by creating a ``stable
pointer'' to a value and passing the stable pointer instead.  For
example, to pass/return an integer lazily to C functions <Literal>storeC</Literal> and

 The compiler uses two non-standard type-classes when
type-checking the arguments and results of <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal>: the arguments
(respectively result) of <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal> must be instances of the class
<Literal>CCallable</Literal> (respectively <Literal>CReturnable</Literal>).  Both classes may be
imported from the module <Literal>CCall</Literal>, but this should only be
necessary if you want to define a new instance.  (Neither class
defines any methods&mdash;their only function is to keep the
type-checker happy.)

The type checker must be able to figure out just which of the
C-callable/returnable types is being used.  If it can't, you have to
add type signatures. For example,


<ProgramListing>
f x = _ccall_ foo x
</ProgramListing>


is not good enough, because the compiler can't work out what type <Literal>x</Literal>
is, nor what type the <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal> returns.  You have to write, say:


<ProgramListing>
f :: Int -&#62; IO Double
f x = _ccall_ foo x
</ProgramListing>


This table summarises the standard instances of these classes.

There are the following restrictions on the form of a qualified
type:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  forall tv1..tvn (c1, ...,cn) =&#62; type
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
(Here, I write the "foralls" explicitly, although the Haskell source
language omits them; in Haskell 1.4, all the free type variables of an
explicit source-language type signature are universally quantified,
except for the class type variables in a class declaration.  However,
in GHC, you can give the foralls if you want.  See <XRef LinkEnd="universal-quantification">).
</Para>

<Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Each universally quantified type variable
<Literal>tvi</Literal> must be mentioned (i.e. appear free) in <Literal>type</Literal></Emphasis>.

The reason for this is that a value with a type that does not obey
this restriction could not be used without introducing
ambiguity. Here, for example, is an illegal type:


<ProgramListing>
  forall a. Eq a =&#62; Int
</ProgramListing>


When a value with this type was used, the constraint <Literal>Eq tv</Literal>
would be introduced where <Literal>tv</Literal> is a fresh type variable, and
(in the dictionary-translation implementation) the value would be
applied to a dictionary for <Literal>Eq tv</Literal>.  The difficulty is that we
can never know which instance of <Literal>Eq</Literal> to use because we never
get any more information about <Literal>tv</Literal>.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Every constraint <Literal>ci</Literal> must mention at least one of the
universally quantified type variables <Literal>tvi</Literal></Emphasis>.

For example, this type is OK because <Literal>C a b</Literal> mentions the
universally quantified type variable <Literal>b</Literal>:


<ProgramListing>
  forall a. C a b =&#62; burble
</ProgramListing>


The next type is illegal because the constraint <Literal>Eq b</Literal> does not
mention <Literal>a</Literal>:


<ProgramListing>
  forall a. Eq b =&#62; burble
</ProgramListing>


The reason for this restriction is milder than the other one.  The
excluded types are never useful or necessary (because the offending
context doesn't need to be witnessed at this point; it can be floated
out).  Furthermore, floating them out increases sharing. Lastly,
excluding them is a conservative choice; it leaves a patch of
territory free in case we need it later.

</Para>

These restrictions apply to all types, whether declared in a type signature

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>The class hierarchy must be acyclic</Emphasis>.  However, the definition
of "acyclic" involves only the superclass relationships.  For example,
this is OK:


<ProgramListing>
  class C a where {
    op :: D b =&#62; a -&#62; b -&#62; b
  }

  class C a =&#62; D a where { ... }
</ProgramListing>


Here, <Literal>C</Literal> is a superclass of <Literal>D</Literal>, but it's OK for a
class operation <Literal>op</Literal> of <Literal>C</Literal> to mention <Literal>D</Literal>.  (It
would not be OK for <Literal>D</Literal> to be a superclass of <Literal>C</Literal>.)

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>There are no restrictions on the context in a class declaration
(which introduces superclasses), except that the class hierarchy must
be acyclic</Emphasis>.  So these class declarations are OK:


<ProgramListing>
  class Functor (m k) =&#62; FiniteMap m k where
    ...

  class (Monad m, Monad (t m)) =&#62; Transform t m where
    lift :: m a -&#62; (t m) a
</ProgramListing>


</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>In the signature of a class operation, every constraint
must mention at least one type variable that is not a class type
variable</Emphasis>.

Thus:


<ProgramListing>
  class Collection c a where
    mapC :: Collection c b =&#62; (a-&#62;b) -&#62; c a -&#62; c b
</ProgramListing>


is OK because the constraint <Literal>(Collection a b)</Literal> mentions
<Literal>b</Literal>, even though it also mentions the class variable
<Literal>a</Literal>.  On the other hand:


<ProgramListing>
  class C a where
    op :: Eq a =&#62; (a,b) -&#62; (a,b)
</ProgramListing>


is not OK because the constraint <Literal>(Eq a)</Literal> mentions on the class
type variable <Literal>a</Literal>, but not <Literal>b</Literal>.  However, any such
example is easily fixed by moving the offending context up to the
superclass context:


<ProgramListing>
  class Eq a =&#62; C a where
    op ::(a,b) -&#62; (a,b)
</ProgramListing>


A yet more relaxed rule would allow the context of a class-op signature
to mention only class type variables.  However, that conflicts with
Rule 1(b) for types above.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>The type of each class operation must mention <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> of
the class type variables</Emphasis>.  For example:


<ProgramListing>
  class Coll s a where
    empty  :: s
    insert :: s -&#62; a -&#62; s
</ProgramListing>


is not OK, because the type of <Literal>empty</Literal> doesn't mention
<Literal>a</Literal>.  This rule is a consequence of Rule 1(a), above, for
types, and has the same motivation.

Sometimes, offending class declarations exhibit misunderstandings.  For
example, <Literal>Coll</Literal> might be rewritten


<ProgramListing>
  class Coll s a where
    empty  :: s a
    insert :: s a -&#62; a -&#62; s a
</ProgramListing>


which makes the connection between the type of a collection of
<Literal>a</Literal>'s (namely <Literal>(s a)</Literal>) and the element type <Literal>a</Literal>.
Occasionally this really doesn't work, in which case you can split the
class like this:


<ProgramListing>
  class CollE s where
    empty  :: s

  class CollE s =&#62; Coll s a where
    insert :: s -&#62; a -&#62; s

"overlap" if <Literal>type1</Literal> and <Literal>type2</Literal> unify

Regrettably, GHC doesn't guarantee to detect overlapping instance
declarations if they appear in different modules.  GHC can "see" the
instance declarations in the transitive closure of all the modules
imported by the one being compiled, so it can "see" all instance decls
when it is compiling <Literal>Main</Literal>.  However, it currently chooses not
to look at ones that can't possibly be of use in the module currently
being compiled, in the interests of efficiency.  (Perhaps we should
change that decision, at least for <Literal>Main</Literal>.)

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>There are no restrictions on the type in an instance
<Emphasis>head</Emphasis>, except that at least one must not be a type variable</Emphasis>.
The instance "head" is the bit after the "=&#62;" in an instance decl. For
example, these are OK:


<ProgramListing>
  instance C Int a where ...

  instance D (Int, Int) where ...

  instance E [[a]] where ...
</ProgramListing>


Note that instance heads <Emphasis>may</Emphasis> contain repeated type variables.
For example, this is OK:


<ProgramListing>
  instance Stateful (ST s) (MutVar s) where ...
</ProgramListing>


The "at least one not a type variable" restriction is to ensure that
context reduction terminates: each reduction step removes one type
constructor.  For example, the following would make the type checker
loop if it wasn't excluded:


<ProgramListing>
  instance C a =&#62; C a where ...
</ProgramListing>


There are two situations in which the rule is a bit of a pain. First,
if one allows overlapping instance declarations then it's quite
convenient to have a "default instance" declaration that applies if
something more specific does not:


<ProgramListing>
  instance C a where
    op = ... -- Default
</ProgramListing>


Second, sometimes you might want to use the following to get the
effect of a "class synonym":


<ProgramListing>
  class (C1 a, C2 a, C3 a) =&#62; C a where { }

  instance (C1 a, C2 a, C3 a) =&#62; C a where { }
</ProgramListing>


This allows you to write shorter signatures:


<ProgramListing>
  f :: C a =&#62; ...
</ProgramListing>


instead of


<ProgramListing>
  f :: (C1 a, C2 a, C3 a) =&#62; ...
</ProgramListing>


I'm on the lookout for a simple rule that preserves decidability while
allowing these idioms.  The experimental flag
<Literal>-fallow-undecidable-instances</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>-fallow-undecidable-instances
option</Primary></IndexTerm> lifts this restriction, allowing all the types in an
instance head to be type variables.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 <Emphasis>Unlike Haskell 1.4, instance heads may use type
synonyms</Emphasis>.  As always, using a type synonym is just shorthand for
writing the RHS of the type synonym definition.  For example:


<ProgramListing>
  type Point = (Int,Int)
  instance C Point   where ...
  instance C [Point] where ...
</ProgramListing>


is legal.  However, if you added


<ProgramListing>
  instance C (Int,Int) where ...
</ProgramListing>


as well, then the compiler will complain about the overlapping
(actually, identical) instance declarations.  As always, type synonyms
must be fully applied.  You cannot, for example, write:


<ProgramListing>
  type P a = [[a]]
  instance Monad P where ...
</ProgramListing>


This design decision is independent of all the others, and easily
reversed, but it makes sense to me.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
<Emphasis>The types in an instance-declaration <Emphasis>context</Emphasis> must all
be type variables</Emphasis>. Thus


<ProgramListing>
instance C a b =&#62; Eq (a,b) where ...
</ProgramListing>


is OK, but


<ProgramListing>
instance C Int b =&#62; Foo b where ...
</ProgramListing>


is not OK.  Again, the intent here is to make sure that context
reduction terminates.

Voluminous correspondence on the Haskell mailing list has convinced me
that it's worth experimenting with a more liberal rule.  If you use
the flag <Literal>-fallow-undecidable-instances</Literal> you can use arbitrary
types in an instance context.  Termination is ensured by having a
fixed-depth recursion stack.  If you exceed the stack depth you get a
sort of backtrace, and the opportunity to increase the stack depth
with <Literal>-fcontext-stack</Literal><Emphasis>N</Emphasis>.

As for type signatures, implicit quantification happens for non-overloaded

it's just as if you had written this:

<ProgramListing>
  data T a = MkT (forall b. Either a b) (forall b. b -&#62; b)

That is, since the type variable <Literal>b</Literal> isn't in scope, it's

<Sect2>
<Title>Pattern matching</Title>

<Para>
When you use pattern matching, the bound variables may now have
polymorphic types.  For example:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
        f :: T a -&#62; a -&#62; (a, Char)
        f (T1 f k) x = (f k x, f 'c' 'd')

        g :: (Ord a, Ord b) =&#62; Swizzle -&#62; [a] -&#62; (a -&#62; b) -&#62; [b]
        g (MkSwizzle s) xs f = s (map f (s xs))

        h :: MonadT m -&#62; [m a] -&#62; m [a]
        h m [] = return m []
        h m (x:xs) = bind m x           $ \y -&#62;
                      bind m (h m xs)   $ \ys -&#62;
                      return m (y:ys)
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
In the function <Literal>h</Literal> we use the record selectors <Literal>return</Literal>
and <Literal>bind</Literal> to extract the polymorphic bind and return functions
from the <Literal>MonadT</Literal> data structure, rather than using pattern
matching.
</Para>

<Para>
You cannot pattern-match against an argument that is polymorphic.
For example:

<ProgramListing>
        newtype TIM s a = TIM (ST s (Maybe a))

        runTIM :: (forall s. TIM s a) -&#62; Maybe a
        runTIM (TIM m) = runST m
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Here the pattern-match fails, because you can't pattern-match against
an argument of type <Literal>(forall s. TIM s a)</Literal>.  Instead you
must bind the variable and pattern match in the right hand side:

<ProgramListing>
        runTIM :: (forall s. TIM s a) -&#62; Maybe a
        runTIM tm = case tm of { TIM m -&#62; runST m }
</ProgramListing>

The <Literal>tm</Literal> on the right hand side is (invisibly) instantiated, like
any polymorphic value at its occurrence site, and now you can pattern-match
against it.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>The partial-application restriction</Title>

<Para>
There is really only one way in which data structures with polymorphic
components might surprise you: you must not partially apply them.
For example, this is illegal:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
        map MkSwizzle [sort, reverse]
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
The restriction is this: <Emphasis>every subexpression of the program must
have a type that has no for-alls, except that in a function
application (f e1&hellip;en) the partial applications are not subject to
this rule</Emphasis>.  The restriction makes type inference feasible.
</Para>

<Para>
In the illegal example, the sub-expression <Literal>MkSwizzle</Literal> has the
polymorphic type <Literal>(Ord b =&#62; [b] -&#62; [b]) -&#62; Swizzle</Literal> and is not
a sub-expression of an enclosing application.  On the other hand, this
expression is OK:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
        map (T1 (\a b -&#62; a)) [1,2,3]
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
even though it involves a partial application of <Literal>T1</Literal>, because
the sub-expression <Literal>T1 (\a b -&#62; a)</Literal> has type <Literal>Int -&#62; T
Int</Literal>.
</Para>

<Sect2 id="sigs">
<Title>Type signatures
</Title>

<Para>
Once you have data constructors with universally-quantified fields, or
constants such as <Literal>runST</Literal> that have rank-2 types, it isn't long
before you discover that you need more!  Consider:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  mkTs f x y = [T1 f x, T1 f y]
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
<Literal>mkTs</Literal> is a fuction that constructs some values of type
<Literal>T</Literal>, using some pieces passed to it.  The trouble is that since
<Literal>f</Literal> is a function argument, Haskell assumes that it is
monomorphic, so we'll get a type error when applying <Literal>T1</Literal> to
it.  This is a rather silly example, but the problem really bites in
practice.  Lots of people trip over the fact that you can't make
"wrappers functions" for <Literal>runST</Literal> for exactly the same reason.
In short, it is impossible to build abstractions around functions with
rank-2 types.
</Para>

<Para>
The solution is fairly clear.  We provide the ability to give a rank-2
type signature for <Emphasis>ordinary</Emphasis> functions (not only data
constructors), thus:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  mkTs :: (forall b. b -&#62; b -&#62; b) -&#62; a -&#62; [T a]
  mkTs f x y = [T1 f x, T1 f y]
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
This type signature tells the compiler to attribute <Literal>f</Literal> with
the polymorphic type <Literal>(forall b. b -&#62; b -&#62; b)</Literal> when type
checking the body of <Literal>mkTs</Literal>, so now the application of
<Literal>T1</Literal> is fine.
</Para>

<Para>
There are two restrictions:
</Para>

<Para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 You can only define a rank 2 type, specified by the following
grammar:


<ProgramListing>
   rank2type ::= [forall tyvars .] [context =&#62;] funty
   funty     ::= ([forall tyvars .] [context =&#62;] ty) -&#62; funty
               | ty
   ty        ::= ...current Haskell monotype syntax...
</ProgramListing>


Informally, the universal quantification must all be right at the beginning,
or at the top level of a function argument.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 There is a restriction on the definition of a function whose
type signature is a rank-2 type: the polymorphic arguments must be
matched on the left hand side of the "<Literal>=</Literal>" sign.  You can't
define <Literal>mkTs</Literal> like this:


<ProgramListing>
  mkTs :: (forall b. b -&#62; b -&#62; b) -&#62; a -&#62; [T a]
  mkTs = \ f x y -&#62; [T1 f x, T1 f y]
</ProgramListing>



The same partial-application rule applies to ordinary functions with
rank-2 types as applied to data constructors.

<Sect1 id="existential-quantification">
<Title>Existentially quantified data constructors
</Title>

<Para>
The idea of using existential quantification in data type declarations
was suggested by Laufer (I believe, thought doubtless someone will
correct me), and implemented in Hope+. It's been in Lennart
Augustsson's <Literal>hbc</Literal> Haskell compiler for several years, and
proved very useful.  Here's the idea.  Consider the declaration:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  data Foo = forall a. MkFoo a (a -&#62; Bool)
           | Nil
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
The data type <Literal>Foo</Literal> has two constructors with types:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  MkFoo :: forall a. a -&#62; (a -&#62; Bool) -&#62; Foo
  Nil   :: Foo
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Notice that the type variable <Literal>a</Literal> in the type of <Literal>MkFoo</Literal>
does not appear in the data type itself, which is plain <Literal>Foo</Literal>.
For example, the following expression is fine:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  [MkFoo 3 even, MkFoo 'c' isUpper] :: [Foo]
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Here, <Literal>(MkFoo 3 even)</Literal> packages an integer with a function
<Literal>even</Literal> that maps an integer to <Literal>Bool</Literal>; and <Literal>MkFoo 'c'
isUpper</Literal> packages a character with a compatible function.  These
two things are each of type <Literal>Foo</Literal> and can be put in a list.
</Para>

<Para>
What can we do with a value of type <Literal>Foo</Literal>?.  In particular,
what happens when we pattern-match on <Literal>MkFoo</Literal>?
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  f (MkFoo val fn) = ???
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Since all we know about <Literal>val</Literal> and <Literal>fn</Literal> is that they
are compatible, the only (useful) thing we can do with them is to
apply <Literal>fn</Literal> to <Literal>val</Literal> to get a boolean.  For example:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  f :: Foo -&#62; Bool
  f (MkFoo val fn) = fn val
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
What this allows us to do is to package heterogenous values
together with a bunch of functions that manipulate them, and then treat
that collection of packages in a uniform manner.  You can express
quite a bit of object-oriented-like programming this way.
</Para>

<Sect2 id="existential">
<Title>Why existential?
</Title>

<Para>
What has this to do with <Emphasis>existential</Emphasis> quantification?
Simply that <Literal>MkFoo</Literal> has the (nearly) isomorphic type
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  MkFoo :: (exists a . (a, a -&#62; Bool)) -&#62; Foo
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
But Haskell programmers can safely think of the ordinary
<Emphasis>universally</Emphasis> quantified type given above, thereby avoiding
adding a new existential quantification construct.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Type classes</Title>

<Para>
An easy extension (implemented in <Literal>hbc</Literal>) is to allow
arbitrary contexts before the constructor.  For example:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  data Baz = forall a. Eq a =&#62; Baz1 a a
           | forall b. Show b =&#62; Baz2 b (b -&#62; b)
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
The two constructors have the types you'd expect:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  Baz1 :: forall a. Eq a =&#62; a -&#62; a -&#62; Baz
  Baz2 :: forall b. Show b =&#62; b -&#62; (b -&#62; b) -&#62; Baz
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
But when pattern matching on <Literal>Baz1</Literal> the matched values can be compared
for equality, and when pattern matching on <Literal>Baz2</Literal> the first matched
value can be converted to a string (as well as applying the function to it).
So this program is legal:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  f :: Baz -&#62; String
  f (Baz1 p q) | p == q    = "Yes"
               | otherwise = "No"
  f (Baz1 v fn)            = show (fn v)
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Operationally, in a dictionary-passing implementation, the
constructors <Literal>Baz1</Literal> and <Literal>Baz2</Literal> must store the
dictionaries for <Literal>Eq</Literal> and <Literal>Show</Literal> respectively, and
extract it on pattern matching.
</Para>

<Para>
Notice the way that the syntax fits smoothly with that used for
universal quantification earlier.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Restrictions</Title>

<Para>
There are several restrictions on the ways in which existentially-quantified
constructors can be use.
</Para>

<Para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 When pattern matching, each pattern match introduces a new,
distinct, type for each existential type variable.  These types cannot
be unified with any other type, nor can they escape from the scope of
the pattern match.  For example, these fragments are incorrect:


<ProgramListing>
  f1 (MkFoo a f) = a
</ProgramListing>


Here, the type bound by <Literal>MkFoo</Literal> "escapes", because <Literal>a</Literal>
is the result of <Literal>f1</Literal>.  One way to see why this is wrong is to
ask what type <Literal>f1</Literal> has:


<ProgramListing>
  f1 :: Foo -&#62; a             -- Weird!
</ProgramListing>


What is this "<Literal>a</Literal>" in the result type? Clearly we don't mean
this:


<ProgramListing>
  f1 :: forall a. Foo -&#62; a   -- Wrong!
</ProgramListing>


The original program is just plain wrong.  Here's another sort of error


<ProgramListing>
  f2 (Baz1 a b) (Baz1 p q) = a==q
</ProgramListing>


It's ok to say <Literal>a==b</Literal> or <Literal>p==q</Literal>, but
<Literal>a==q</Literal> is wrong because it equates the two distinct types arising
from the two <Literal>Baz1</Literal> constructors.


</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
You can't pattern-match on an existentially quantified
constructor in a <Literal>let</Literal> or <Literal>where</Literal> group of
bindings. So this is illegal:


<ProgramListing>
  f3 x = a==b where { Baz1 a b = x }
</ProgramListing>


You can only pattern-match
on an existentially-quantified constructor in a <Literal>case</Literal> expression or
in the patterns of a function definition.

The reason for this restriction is really an implementation one.
Type-checking binding groups is already a nightmare without
existentials complicating the picture.  Also an existential pattern
binding at the top level of a module doesn't make sense, because it's
not clear how to prevent the existentially-quantified type "escaping".
So for now, there's a simple-to-state restriction.  We'll see how
annoying it is.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
You can't use existential quantification for <Literal>newtype</Literal>
declarations.  So this is illegal:


<ProgramListing>
  newtype T = forall a. Ord a =&#62; MkT a
</ProgramListing>


Reason: a value of type <Literal>T</Literal> must be represented as a pair
of a dictionary for <Literal>Ord t</Literal> and a value of type <Literal>t</Literal>.
That contradicts the idea that <Literal>newtype</Literal> should have no
concrete representation.  You can get just the same efficiency and effect
by using <Literal>data</Literal> instead of <Literal>newtype</Literal>.  If there is no
overloading involved, then there is more of a case for allowing
an existentially-quantified <Literal>newtype</Literal>, because the <Literal>data</Literal>
because the <Literal>data</Literal> version does carry an implementation cost,
but single-field existentially quantified constructors aren't much
use.  So the simple restriction (no existential stuff on <Literal>newtype</Literal>)
stands, unless there are convincing reasons to change it.


</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 You can't use <Literal>deriving</Literal> to define instances of a
data type with existentially quantified data constructors.

Reason: in most cases it would not make sense. For example:&num;

<ProgramListing>
  data T = forall a. MkT [a] deriving( Eq )
</ProgramListing>

To derive <Literal>Eq</Literal> in the standard way we would need to have equality
between the single component of two <Literal>MkT</Literal> constructors:

<ProgramListing>
  instance Eq T where
    (MkT a) == (MkT b) = ???
</ProgramListing>

But <Literal>a</Literal> and <Literal>b</Literal> have distinct types, and so can't be compared.
It's just about possible to imagine examples in which the derived instance
would make sense, but it seems altogether simpler simply to prohibit such
declarations.  Define your own instances!

If you want to make use of assertions in your standard Haskell code, you

assert :: Bool -&#62; a -&#62; a
assert False x = error "assertion failed!"
assert _     x = x

which works, but gives you back a less than useful error message --
an assertion failed, but which and where?
</Para>

<Para>
One way out is to define an extended <Literal>assert</Literal> function which also
takes a descriptive string to include in the error message and
perhaps combine this with the use of a pre-processor which inserts
the source location where <Literal>assert</Literal> was used.
</Para>

<Para>
Ghc offers a helping hand here, doing all of this for you. For every

Ghc will rewrite this to also include the source location where the
assertion was made,
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
assert pred val ==&#62; assertError "Main.hs|15" pred val

</Para>

<Para>
The rewrite is only performed by the compiler when it spots
applications of <Literal>Exception.assert</Literal>, so you can still define and
use your own versions of <Literal>assert</Literal>, should you so wish. If not,
import <Literal>Exception</Literal> to make use <Literal>assert</Literal> in your code.

To have the compiler ignore uses of assert, use the compiler option

It's illegal because <Literal>a</Literal> is not in scope in the body of <Literal>f</Literal>,

 Pattern type signatures, including the result part, can be used
in <Literal>case</Literal> expressions:


<ProgramListing>
  case e of { (x::a, y) :: a -&#62; x }
</ProgramListing>


The pattern-bound type variables must, as usual,
be polymorphic in the following sense: each case alternative,
considered as a lambda abstraction, must be polymorphic.
Thus this is OK:


<ProgramListing>
  case (True,False) of { (x::a, y) -&#62; x }
</ProgramListing>


Even though the context is that of a pair of booleans,
the alternative itself is polymorphic.  Of course, it is
also OK to say:


<ProgramListing>
  case (True,False) of { (x::Bool, y) -&#62; x }
</ProgramListing>


</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
To avoid ambiguity, the type after the ``<Literal>::</Literal>'' in a result
pattern signature on a lambda or <Literal>case</Literal> must be atomic (i.e. a single
token or a parenthesised type of some sort).  To see why,
consider how one would parse this:


<ProgramListing>
  \ x :: a -&#62; b -&#62; x
</ProgramListing>


</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Pattern type signatures that bind new type variables
may not be used in pattern bindings at all.
So this is illegal:


<ProgramListing>
  f x = let (y, z::a) = x in ...
</ProgramListing>


But these are OK, because they do not bind fresh type variables:


<ProgramListing>
  f1 x            = let (y, z::Int) = x in ...
  f2 (x::(Int,a)) = let (y, z::a)   = x in ...
</ProgramListing>


However a single variable is considered a degenerate function binding,
rather than a degerate pattern binding, so this is permitted, even
though it binds a type variable:


<ProgramListing>
  f :: (b-&#62;b) = \(x::b) -&#62; x
</ProgramListing>


</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

Such degnerate function bindings do not fall under the monomorphism
restriction.  Thus:
</Para>

<Para>

<ProgramListing>
  g :: a -&#62; a -&#62; Bool = \x y. x==y
</ProgramListing>

</Para>

<Para>
Here <Literal>g</Literal> has type <Literal>forall a. Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</Literal>, just as if
<Literal>g</Literal> had a separate type signature.  Lacking a type signature, <Literal>g</Literal>
would get a monomorphic type.

GHC (with <Literal>-O</Literal>, as always) tries to inline (or ``unfold'')

<Para>
You will probably see these unfoldings (in Core syntax) in your

Normally, if GHC decides a function is ``too expensive'' to inline, it

</Para>

<Para>
The major effect of an <Literal>INLINE</Literal> pragma is to declare a function's

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Each variable mentioned in a rule must either be in scope (e.g. <Literal>map</Literal>),
or bound by the <Literal>forall</Literal> (e.g. <Literal>f</Literal>, <Literal>g</Literal>, <Literal>xs</Literal>).  The variables bound by
the <Literal>forall</Literal> are called the <Emphasis>pattern</Emphasis> variables.  They are separated
by spaces, just like in a type <Literal>forall</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
 A pattern variable may optionally have a type signature.
If the type of the pattern variable is polymorphic, it <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> have a type signature.
For example, here is the <Literal>foldr/build</Literal> rule:

  "fold/build"  forall k z (g::forall b. (a-&#62;b-&#62;b) -&#62; b -&#62; b) .
                foldr k z (build g) = g k z

Since <Literal>g</Literal> has a polymorphic type, it must have a type signature.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 The left hand side of a rule must consist of a top-level variable applied

In <Literal>"wrong1"</Literal>, the LHS is not an application; in <Literal>"wrong1"</Literal>, the LHS has a pattern variable

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 Rules are regarded as left-to-right rewrite rules.
When GHC finds an expression that is a substitution instance of the LHS
of a rule, it replaces the expression by the (appropriately-substituted) RHS.
By "a substitution instance" we mean that the LHS can be made equal to the
expression by substituting for the pattern variables.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 The LHS and RHS of a rule are typechecked, and must have the
same type.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 GHC makes absolutely no attempt to verify that the LHS and RHS
of a rule have the same meaning.  That is undecideable in general, and
infeasible in most interesting cases.  The responsibility is entirely the programmer's!

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 GHC makes no attempt to make sure that the rules are confluent or
terminating.  For example:

<ProgramListing>
  "loop"        forall x,y.  f x y = f y x
</ProgramListing>

This rule will cause the compiler to go into an infinite loop.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 If more than one rule matches a call, GHC will choose one arbitrarily to apply.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
 GHC currently uses a very simple, syntactic, matching algorithm
for matching a rule LHS with an expression.  It seeks a substitution
which makes the LHS and expression syntactically equal modulo alpha
conversion.  The pattern (rule), but not the expression, is eta-expanded if
necessary.  (Eta-expanding the epression can lead to laziness bugs.)
But not beta conversion (that's called higher-order matching).
</Para>

<Para>
Matching is carried out on GHC's intermediate language, which includes
type abstractions and applications.  So a rule only matches if the
types match too.  See <XRef LinkEnd="rule-spec"> below.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 GHC keeps trying to apply the rules as it optimises the program.
For example, consider:

<ProgramListing>
  let s = map f
      t = map g
  in
  s (t xs)
</ProgramListing>

The expression <Literal>s (t xs)</Literal> does not match the rule <Literal>"map/map"</Literal>, but GHC
will substitute for <Literal>s</Literal> and <Literal>t</Literal>, giving an expression which does match.
If <Literal>s</Literal> or <Literal>t</Literal> was (a) used more than once, and (b) large or a redex, then it would
not be substituted, and the rule would not fire.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 In the earlier phases of compilation, GHC inlines <Emphasis>nothing
that appears on the LHS of a rule</Emphasis>, because once you have substituted
for something you can't match against it (given the simple minded
matching).  So if you write the rule

<ProgramListing>
        "map/map"       forall f,g.  map f . map g = map (f.g)
</ProgramListing>

this <Emphasis>won't</Emphasis> match the expression <Literal>map f (map g xs)</Literal>.
It will only match something written with explicit use of ".".
Well, not quite.  It <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> match the expression

<ProgramListing>
        wibble f g xs
</ProgramListing>

where <Literal>wibble</Literal> is defined:

<ProgramListing>
        wibble f g = map f . map g
</ProgramListing>

because <Literal>wibble</Literal> will be inlined (it's small).

Later on in compilation, GHC starts inlining even things on the
LHS of rules, but still leaves the rules enabled.  This inlining
policy is controlled by the per-simplification-pass flag <Literal>-finline-phase</Literal>n.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
 All rules are implicitly exported from the module, and are therefore
in force in any module that imports the module that defined the rule, directly
or indirectly.  (That is, if A imports B, which imports C, then C's rules are
in force when compiling A.)  The situation is very similar to that for instance
declarations.

This told GHC to use <Literal>int8ToInt16</Literal> instead of <Literal>fromIntegral</Literal> whenever
the latter was called with type <Literal>Int8 -&gt; Int16</Literal>.  That is, rather than
specialising the original definition of <Literal>fromIntegral</Literal> the programmer is

This feature is no longer in GHC.  But rewrite rules let you do the
same thing:

<ProgramListing>

This slightly odd-looking rule instructs GHC to replace <Literal>fromIntegral</Literal>
