<sect1>Compiler release notes
<p>

<itemize>
<item> To reflect the fact that the <tt/Pretty/ library is part of
the common Hugs / GHC extension libraries, <tt/Pretty/ has been moved
from the <tt/misc/ library to <tt/exts/, i.e., only <tt/syslib exts/
should be required to get at these extension libraries.
