The <tt/Weak/ library provides a "weak pointer" abstraction, giving
the user some control over the garbage collection of specified
objects, and allowing objects to be "finalized" with an arbitrary
Haskell IO computation when they die.

Weak pointers partially replace the old foreign object interface, as
we will explain later.

<sect1>Weak pointers
<p>

In general terms, a weak pointer is a reference to an object that is
not followed by the garbage collector --- that is, the existence of a
weak pointer to an object has no effect on the lifetime of that
object.  A weak pointer can be de-referenced to find out
whether the object it refers to is still alive or not, and if so
to return the object itself.

Weak pointers are particularly useful for caches and memo tables.
To build a memo table, you build a data structure 
mapping from the function argument (the key) to its result (the
value).  When you apply the function to a new argument you first
check whether the key/value pair is already in the memo table.
The key point is that the memo table itself should not keep the
key and value alive.  So the table should contain a weak pointer
to the key, not an ordinary pointer.  The pointer to the value must
not be weak, because the only reference to the value might indeed be
from the memo table.   

So it looks as if the memo table will keep all its values
alive for ever.  One way to solve this is to purge the table
occasionally, by deleting entries whose keys have died.

The weak pointers in this library
support another approach, called <em/finalization/.
When the key referred to by a weak pointer dies, the storage manager
arranges to run a programmer-specified finalizer.  In the case of memo
tables, for example, the finalizer could remove the key/value pair
from the memo table.  

Another difficulty with the memo table is that the value of a
key/value pair might itself contain a pointer to the key.
So the memo table keeps the value alive, which keeps the key alive,
even though there may be no other references to the key so both should
die.  The weak pointers in this library provide a slight 
generalisation of the basic weak-pointer idea, in which each
weak pointer actually contains both a key and a value.
We describe this in more detail below.

<sect1>The simple interface
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
	mkWeakPtr    :: a -> Maybe (IO ()) -> IO (Weak a)
	deRefWeak    :: Weak a -> IO (Maybe a)
	addFinalizer :: a -> IO () -> IO ()
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/mkWeakPtr/ takes a value of any type <tt/a/, and maybe a finalizer
of type <tt/IO ()/, and returns a weak pointer object referring to the
value, of type <tt/Weak a/.  It is in the <tt/IO/ monad because it has
the side effect of arranging that the finalizer (if there is one) will
be run when the object dies.  In what follows, a ``weak pointer
object'', or ``weak pointer'' for short, means precisely ``a Haskell
value of type <tt/Weak t/'' for some type <tt/t/.  A weak pointer
(object) is a first-class Haskell value; it can be passed to
functions, stored in data structures, and so on.

<tt/deRefWeak/ dereferences a weak pointer, returning <tt/Just v/ if
the value is still alive.  If the key has already died, then
<tt/deRefWeak/ returns <tt/Nothing/; that's why it's in the <tt/IO/
monad - the return value of <tt/deRefWeak/ depends on when the garbage
collector runs.

<tt/addFinalizer/ is just another name for <tt/mkWeakPtr/ except that
it throws the weak pointer itself away.  (The runtime system will
remember that the weak pointer and hence the finalizer exists even if
the program has forgotten it.)

<tscreen><verb>
  addFinalizer :: a -> IO () -> IO ()
  addFinalizer v f = do { mkWeakPtr v f; return () }
</verb></tscreen>

The effect of <tt/addFinalizer/ is simply that the finalizer runs when
the referenced object dies.

The following properties hold:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/deRefWeak/ returns the original object until
that object is considered dead; it returns <tt/Nothing/
subsequently.
<item>
Every finalizer will eventually be run, exactly once, either
soon after the object dies, or at the end of the program.
There is no requirement for the programmer to hold onto the
weak pointer itself; finalization is completely unaffected by
whether the weak pointer itself is alive.
<item>
There may be multiple weak pointers to a single object.
In this case, the finalizers for each of these weak pointers will
all be run in some arbitrary order, or perhaps concurrently,
when the object dies.  If the programmer specifies a finalizer that
assumes it has the only reference to an object
(for example, a file that it wishes to close), then the programmer
must ensure that there is only one such finalizer.
<item>
The storage manager attempts to run the finalizer(s) for an
object soon after the object dies, but promptness is not guaranteed.
(What is guaranteed is that the finalizer will
eventually run, exactly once.)
<item>
At the moment when a finalizer is run, a call to <tt/deRefWeak/
will return <tt/Nothing/.
<item>
A finalizer may contain a pointer to the object, but that pointer
will not keep the object alive.  For example:
<tscreen><verb>
  f :: Show a => a -> IO a
  f x = addFinalizer x (print (show x))
</verb></tscreen>
Here the finalizer <tt/print (show x)/ contains a reference to <tt/x/
itself, but that does not keep <tt/x/ alive.  When that is the only
reference to <tt/x/, the finalizer is run; and the message appears
on the screen.
<item>
A finalizer may even resurrect the object, by (say) storing it in
some global data structure.
</itemize>

<sect1>The general interface
<p>

The <tt/Weak/ library offers a slight generalisation of 
the simple weak pointers described so far: 
<tscreen><verb>
        mkWeak :: k -> v -> Maybe (IO ()) -> IO (Weak v)
</verb></tscreen>
<tt/mkWeak/ takes a key of any type <tt/k/ and a value of any type
<tt/v/, as well as a finalizer, and returns a weak pointer of type
<tt/Weak v/.  

<tt/deRefWeak/ returns the <em/value/ only, not the key, as its 
type (given above) implies:
<tscreen><verb>
	deRefWeak :: Weak a -> IO (Maybe a)
</verb></tscreen>
However, <tt/deRefWeak/ returns <tt/Nothing/ if the <em/key/, not the
value, has died.  Furthermore, references from the value to the key
do not keep the key alive, in the same way that the finalizer does
not keep the key alive.

Simple weak pointers are readily defined in terms of these more general
weak pointers:
<tscreen><verb>
  mkWeakPtr :: a -> Maybe (IO ()) -> IO (Weak a)
  mkWeakPtr v f = mkWeak v v f
</verb></tscreen>

These more general weak pointers are enough to implement memo
tables properly.

A weak pointer can be finalized early, using the <tt/finalize/ operation:

<tscreen><verb>
finalize :: Weak v -> IO ()
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1> A precise semantics
<p>
The above informal specification is fine for simple situations,
but matters can get complicated.  In particular, it needs to
be clear exactly when a key dies, so that any weak pointers 
that refer to it can be finalized.
Suppose, for example, the value of one weak pointer refers
to the key of another...does that keep the key alive?

The behaviour is simply this:

<itemize>
<item> If a weak pointer (object) refers to an <em/unreachable/
key, it may be finalized.
<item> Finalization means (a) arrange that subsequent calls
to <tt/deRefWeak/ return <tt/Nothing/; and (b) run the finalizer.
</itemize>

This behaviour depends on what it means for a key to be reachable.
Informally,
something is reachable if it can be reached by following ordinary
pointers from the root set, but not following weak pointers.
We define reachability more precisely as 
follows
A heap object is reachable if:

<itemize>
<item> It is a member of the <em/root set/.
<item> It is directly pointed to by a reachable object, other than
a weak pointer object.
<item> It is a weak pointer object whose key is reachable.
<item> It is the value or finalizer of an object whose key is
reachable.
</itemize>

The root set consists of all runnable threads, and all stable pointers
(see Section <ref id="sec:stable-pointers" name="Stable Pointers">).
NOTE: currently all top-level objects are considered to be reachable,
although we hope to remove this restriction in the future.  A
<tt/Char/ or small <tt/Int/ will also be constantly reachable, since
the garbage collector replaces heap-resident <tt/Char/s and small
<tt/Int/s with pointers to static copies.

Notice that a pointer to the key from its associated 
value or finalizer does not make the key reachable.
However, if the key is reachable some other way, then the value
and the finalizer are reachable, and so, therefore, are any other
keys they refer to directly or indirectly.


<sect1>Finalization for foreign objects
<label id="foreign-finalizers">
<p>

A foreign object is some data that lives outside the Haskell heap, for
example some <tt/malloc/ed data in C land.  It's useful to be able to
know when the Haskell program no longer needs the <tt/malloc/ed data,
so it can be <tt/free/d.  We can use weak pointers and finalizers for
this, but we have to be careful: the foreign data is usually
referenced by an address, ie. an <tt/Addr/ (see Section <ref
name="Addr" id="sec:Addr">), and we must retain the invariant that
<em/if the Haskell program still needs the foreign object, then it
retains the <tt/Addr/ object in the heap/.  This invariant isn't
guaranteed to hold if we use <tt/Addr/, because an <tt/Addr/ consists
of a box around a raw address <tt/Addr#/.  If the Haskell program can
manipulate the <tt/Addr#/ object independently of the heap-resident
<tt/Addr/, then the foreign object could be inadvertently finalized
early, because a weak pointer to the <tt/Addr/ would find no more
references to its key and trigger the finalizer despite the fact that
the program still holds the <tt/Addr#/ and intends to use it.

To avoid this somewhat subtle race condition, we use another type of
foreign address, called <tt/ForeignObj/ (see Section <ref
id="sec:Foreign" name="Foreign">).  Historical note: <tt/ForeignObj/
is identical to the old <tt/ForeignObj/ except that it no longer
supports finalization - that's provided by the weak
pointer/finalization mechanism above.

A <tt/ForeignObj/ is basically an address, but the <tt/ForeignObj/
itself is a heap-resident object and can therefore be watched by weak
pointers.  A <tt/ForeignObj/ can be passed to C functions (in which
case the C function gets a straightforward pointer), but it cannot be
decomposed into an <tt/Addr#/.
