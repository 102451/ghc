  This library provides a convenient bundle of most of the extensions
  available in GHC and Hugs.  This module is generally more stable than
  the other modules of non-standard extensions so you might choose to 
  import them from here rather than going straight to the horses mouth.
  
  <tscreen><verb>
  module GlaExts( module GlaExts, module IOExts, module ST, module Addr ) where
  import IOExts
  import ST
  import Addr
  trace              :: String -> a -> a
  performGC          :: IO ()
  </verb></tscreen>
  
  The GHC version also provides the types <tt/RealWorld/,
  <tt/ByteArray/, <tt/Lift/ and operations on these types. It also
  provides the unboxed views of the types
  <tt/Int/, 
  <tt/Addr/, 
  <tt/Word/, 
  <tt/Float/, 
  <tt/Double/, 
  <tt/Integer/ and
  <tt/Char/ 
  and a number of ``primitive operations'' (<tt/+&num/,
  <tt/plusFloat&num/, etc.).
