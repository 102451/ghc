In order to get a build tree into a state in which it can be used to
make an InstallShield, the following steps must be performed; these
should be put into the build system itself (under make install) so
that this "laying on of hands" is unnecessary.

1. cp ghc/compiler/ghc-x.yy ghc/compiler/ghc.exe
2. cp ghc/utils/ghc-pkg/ghc-pkg.bin ghc/utils/ghc-pkg/ghc-pkg.exe
3. strip ghc/compiler/ghc.exe ghc/driver/ghci/ghci.exe hslibs/tools/*/*.exe ghc/utils/*/*.exe
4. (cd ghc/docs/set && make set.html set.ps && ps2pdf[.bat] set.ps set.pdf)
5. Make License and ANNOUNCE into RTF, and overwrite the old versions
in ghc/WindowsInstaller.
