In order to get a build tree into a state in which it can be used to
make an InstallShield, the following steps must be performed; these
should be put into the build system itself (under make install) so
that this "laying on of hands" is unnecessary.

1. cp ghc/compiler/ghc-x.yy ghc/compiler/ghc.exe
2. strip ghc/compiler/ghc.exe ghc/driver/ghci/ghci.exe hslibs/tools/*/*.exe
3. cp ghc/utils/ghc-pkg/ghc-pkg.bin ghc/utils/ghc-pkg/ghc-pkg.exe
4. strip ghc/utils/*/*.exe
5. (cd docs/building && make building.ps && ps2pdf building.ps building.pdf)
6. (cd ghc/docs/set && make set.ps && ps2pdf set.ps set.pdf)
7. Make License and ANNOUNCE into RTF (or just rename as RTF?).

It also seems necessary to run jadetex once more on the docs before
turning them into PS. The docs are built correctly under Linux, so I'm
not sure what goes wrong here.
