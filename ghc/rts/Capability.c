 * A Capability represent the token required to execute STG code,
 * and all the state an OS thread/task needs to run Haskell code:
 * its STG registers, a pointer to its TSO, a nursery etc. During
 * STG execution, a pointer to the capabilitity is kept in a
 * register (BaseReg).
 *
 * Only in an SMP build will there be multiple capabilities, for
 * the threaded RTS and other non-threaded builds, there is only
 * one global capability, namely MainCapability.
