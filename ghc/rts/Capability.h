 *
 * Capabilities
 *
 * The notion of a capability is used when operating in multi-threaded
 * environments (which the SMP and Threads builds of the RTS do), to
 * hold all the state an OS thread/task needs to run Haskell code:
 * its STG registers, a pointer to its  TSO, a nursery etc. During
 * STG execution, a pointer to the capabilitity is kept in a 
 * register (BaseReg).
 *
 * Only in an SMP build will there be multiple capabilities, the threaded
 * RTS and other non-threaded builds, there is one global capability,
 * namely MainRegTable.
 *
 * This header file contains the functions for working with capabilities.
 * (the main, and only, consumer of this interface is the scheduler).
