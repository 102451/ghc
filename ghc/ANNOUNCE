    The (Interactive) Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 5.02
   ============================================================

We are pleased to announce a new major release of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC), version 5.02.  The source distribution is freely
available via the World-Wide Web, under a BSD-style license.  See
below for download details.  Pre-built packages for Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris and Win32 are also available.

Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language; the
current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating good code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces (C, C++, whatever).

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page at

 What's new
============

5.02 incorporates many small refinements and bug fixes over the previous 
stable release (5.00.2).  There are no major changes.  

   - Much improved support for Windows platforms.  Binary builds are
     now entirely freestanding.  There's no need to install Cygwin or
     Mingwin to use it.  It's a one-click-install-and-off-you-go story now.

   - Several small changes to bring GHC into line with the newest Haskell 98 
     report.

   - GHCi (the interactive system) now works on Windows.

   - Partial FFI support in GHCi.  At the moment, foreign import (both
     static and dynamic) is supported on x86 and sparc platforms.

   - A compacting garbage collector, to try and reduce space use.

   - Experimental: partial support for hierarchical module names.

   - Experimental: following heroic hacking by Ken Shan, 5.02 now
     works on Alpha (Tru64 only).  Many 64-bit bugs have been shaken
     out.  At the moment only the batch-mode compiler works -- no GHCi
     or native code generator yet.

We've found and fixed more bugs than you could possibly imagine.  A
big thank-you to all those who reported bugs in the 5.00.X series.  We
claim to have fixed almost all reported bugs.  In general we've spent
a large amount of effort trying to improve the stability of the
system relative to 5.00.X.  (Famous last words ...)

 How to get it
===============

The easy way is to go to the WWW page, which should be
self-explanatory:

        http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for various
flavours of Linux and BSD, and in InstallShield form for Windows
folks.  Everybody else gets a .tar.gz which can be installed where you
want.

Once you have the distribution, please follow the pointers in the
README file to find all of the documentation about this release.



 On-line GHC-related resources

 System requirements
=====================

To compile programs with GHC, you need a machine with 64+MB memory, GNU C
and perl. This release is known to work on the following platforms:

  * i386-unknown-{linux,freebsd,mingw32}
  * sparc-sun-solaris2

Ports to the following platforms should be relatively easy (for a
wunderhacker), but haven't been tested due to lack of time/hardware:

  * hppa1.1-hp-hpux{9,10}
  * i386-unknown-solaris2
  * alpha-dec-osf{2,3}
  * mips-sgi-irix{5,6}
  * {rs6000,powerpc}-ibm-aix

The builder's guide included in distribution gives a complete
run-down of what ports work; an on-line version can be found at
