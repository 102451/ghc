	     The Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 4.02
	    ==============================================

We are pleased to announce a new release of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC), version 4.02.  The source distribution is freely
available via the World-Wide Web and through anon. FTP; details below.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language; the
current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998.
Haskell related information is available from the Haskell home page at

	http://haskell.org/

GHC has a new Web page; point your browser at

	http://research.microsoft.com/users/t-simonm/ghc/

+ What's new
=============

GHC 4.02 fixes several bugs in 4.01 and adds the following major features:

	* Full Haskell 98 language support,

	* Scoped type variables,

	* Better warnings for unused variables,

	* A new generational garbage collector.

The following things have not been fixed yet:

	* The native code generator is still flaky, and is turned off by
	  default for the time being.

	* The profiler is still flaky.

See the release notes for full details:

	http://research.microsoft.com/users/t-simonm/ghc/Docs/latest/users_guide/users_guide-1.html#ss1.4

A source distribution and binaries for common architectures are
available from the web page.

+ Mailing lists
================

We run mailing lists for GHC users and bug reports; to subscribe, send
mail to majordomo@haskell.org; the msg body should be:

    subscribe glasgow-haskell-<which> Your Name <your-email@where.you.are>

Please send bug reports about GHC to glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org ; GHC
users hang out on glasgow-haskell-users@haskell.org

+ How to get it
================

The easy way is to go to the WWW page, which should be
self-explanatory:

Once you have the distribution, please follow the pointers in the
README file to find all of the documentation about this release.  NB:
preserve modification times when un-tarring the files (no `m' option
for tar, please)!


+ System requirements
======================

To compile up this source-only release, you need a machine with 32+MB
memory, GNU C (`gcc'), `perl' plus a version of GHC installed (version
2.10 at least, 3.02 recommended).  This release is known to work on
the following platforms:

  * i386-unknown-{linux,solaris2,freebsd,cygwin32}
  * sparc-sun-{sunos4,solaris2}

Ports to the following platforms should be relatively easy, but
haven't been tested due to lack of time/hardware:

  * alpha-dec-osf{2,3}
  * hppa1.1-hp-hpux{9,10}
  * mips-sgi-irix{5,6}
  * {rs6000,powerpc}-ibm-aix

The installer's guide included in distribution gives a complete
run-down of what-ports-work; an on-line version can be found at
