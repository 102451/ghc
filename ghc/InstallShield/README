This is the InstallShield setup for GHC; it can be used as a model for other
IS setups.

Notes:

1. This IS setup is for the full version of IS, *not* the one that comes
with MS Visual Studio.

2. This directory is liable to change/expansion/removal as we get IS
projects for all the major fptools bits together and add them to the
repository.
