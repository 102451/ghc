 
tcfail032.hs:14: A type signature is more polymorphic than the inferred type
		     Some type variables in the inferred type can't be forall'd, namely:
		     `a{-aG1-}'
		     Possible cause: the RHS mentions something subject to the monomorphism restriction
    In an expression with a type signature:
	`x ::
	   _forall_ [a] {PrelBase.Eq a} => a -> PrelBase.Int'
