Known bugs in nativeGen, 000124 (JRS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All these bugs are for x86; I don't know about sparc/alpha.

-- absC -> stix translation for GET_TAG and in fact anything
   to do with the packed-halfword layout info itbl field is
   pretty dubious.  I think I have it fixed for big and little
   endian 32-bit, but it won't work at all on a 64 bit platform.

-- nofib/spectral/cvh_unboxing exposes some kind of spilling bug
   (I think), since there are many references to registers %M229
   etc, which I believe are dynamic registers which didn't get assigned
   to real ones.
