    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `res' escapes; i.e. unifies with something more global
    When checking the type signature for an expression
	Signature: (a -> m res1) -> m res1
	Inferred:  (a -> m res) -> m res
    In the first argument of `KContT', namely `(\ cont' -> cont a)'
    In the right-hand side of a lambda abstraction:
