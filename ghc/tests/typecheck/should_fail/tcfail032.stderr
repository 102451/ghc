    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `a' escapes; i.e. unifies with something more global
    When checking the type signature for an expression
	Signature: a -> Int
	Inferred:  a -> Int
    In an expression with a type signature:
	  x :: forall a. (PrelBase.Eq a) => a -> Int
