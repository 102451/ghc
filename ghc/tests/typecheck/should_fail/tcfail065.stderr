    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `x' escapes
	It unifies with `x1', which is mentioned in the environment
** SLPJ: I HATE THE 'unifies with' PART **
	The following variables in the environment mention `x1'
** AND NOTHING MENTIONED! **
    When checking the type signature
	setX :: forall x2. x2 -> X x1 -> X x1
    In the definition for method `setX'
