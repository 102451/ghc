		     `taCS' with the type `taD6 -> taD3 -> taD3'
    Expected: `taCS'
    Inferred: `taD6 -> taD3 -> taD3'
    In a pattern binding:
	`p = PrelBase.foldr (f c) PrelBase.[] PrelBase.[]'
    In an equation for function `g':
	`g c
	   = c
	   where
	       p = PrelBase.foldr (f c) PrelBase.[] PrelBase.[]'
 
tcfail071.hs:8: Mismatched contexts
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for `f' and `g'
	(the signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical)
