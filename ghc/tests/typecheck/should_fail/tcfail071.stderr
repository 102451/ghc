		     `taDJ' with the type `taDW -> taDT -> taDT'
    Expected: `taDJ'
    Inferred: `taDW -> taDT -> taDT'
    In the first argument of `f', namely `c'
    In the first argument of `foldr', namely `(f c)'
    In a pattern binding: `p = foldr (f c) [] []'
 
tcfail071.hs:8: Mismatched contexts
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for `f' and `g'
	(the signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical)
