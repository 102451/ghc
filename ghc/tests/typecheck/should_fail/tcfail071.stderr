		     `taEm' with the type `taEz -> taEw -> taEw'
    Expected: `taEm'
    Inferred: `taEz -> taEw -> taEw'
    In the first argument of `f', namely `c'
    In the first argument of `foldr', namely `(f c)'
    In a pattern binding: `p = foldr (f c) [] []'
 
tcfail071.hs:8: Mismatched contexts
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for `f' and `g'
	(the signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical)
