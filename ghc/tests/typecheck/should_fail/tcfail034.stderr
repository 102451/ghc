tcfail034.hs:17:
    Could not deduce `Integral a' from the context: (Num a, Eq a)
    Probable cause: missing `Integral a' in type signature for `test'
    arising from use of `mod' at tcfail034.hs:17
    In the first argument of `==', namely `(x `mod` 3)'
    In the right-hand side of an equation for `test': (x `mod` 3) == 0
