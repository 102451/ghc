tcfail067.hs:60:
    Could not deduce `Show (SubRange a)' from the context (Num a1)
    Probable fix:
	Add `Show (SubRange a)' to the instance declaration context
	Or add an instance declaration for `Show (SubRange a)'
    arising from an instance declaration at tcfail067.hs:60

tcfail067.hs:61:
    Could not deduce `Ord a'
	from the context (Num (SubRange a1),
			  Num a1,
			  Eq (SubRange a1),
			  Show (SubRange a1))
    Probable fix:
	Add `Ord a' to the instance declaration context
    arising from use of `numSubRangeNegate' at tcfail067.hs:61
    In the right-hand side of an equation for `negate':
	numSubRangeNegate

tcfail067.hs:74:
    Could not deduce `Ord a' from the context (Num a)
    Probable fix:
	Add `Ord a' to the type signature for `numSubRangeBinOp'
    arising from use of `SubRange' at tcfail067.hs:74
    In the right-hand side of an equation for `numSubRangeBinOp':
	SubRange (result, result) result
