The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
============================

(this file is fptools/ghc/README in a source distribution, and
fptools/README in a binary distribution).

GHC is a batch compiler for Haskell 98.  See the file ANNOUNCE for
information on the current version.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
Haskell 98 is the current version of the language, released in 
December 1998.  The language definition is on the Web at
http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/Haskell/haskell98.html

More information on GHC can be found on its web page

GHC documentation of interest:

* docs/installing.{dvi,html}: How to configure, build, and
  install the system.

  The document, as with many others, is in TeX-produced DVI format
  (.dvi suffix), or HTML.

* ghc/docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,html}: How to use GHC; e.g., what
  options are available, how to cope with common problems, how to use
  the profiling facilities, etc.

* ghc/docs/libraries/libs.{dvi,html}: Several libraries that are
  provided by both GHC and Hugs.

We welcome your comments and suggestions about this software!  Please
do not suffer or grumble in silence.  The "bug reports" section of the
User's Guide says what we would like to know when you report a
problem.
