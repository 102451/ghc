<Abstract>

<para>
This guide is intended for people who want to build or modify
programs from the Glasgow <Literal>fptools</Literal> suite (as distinct from those
who merely want to <Emphasis>run</Emphasis> them). Installation instructions are now provided in the user guide.
</para>

<para>
The bulk of this guide applies to building on Unix systems; see <XRef LinkEnd="winbuild"> for Windows notes.

<Sect1 id="sec-getting">
<Title>Getting the Glasgow <Literal>fptools</Literal> suite
</Title>

<para>
Building the Glasgow tools <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> be complicated, mostly because
there are so many permutations of what/why/how, e.g., ``Build Happy
with HBC, everything else with GHC, leave out profiling, and test it
all on the `real' NoFib programs.''  Yeeps!
</para>

<para>
Happily, such complications don't apply to most people.  A few common
``strategies'' serve most purposes.  Pick one and proceed
as suggested:
</para>

<Term><IndexTerm><Primary>Binary distribution</Primary></IndexTerm>Binary distribution.</Term>
<ListItem>
<para>
If your only purpose is to install some of the
<Literal>fptools</Literal> suite then the easiest thing to do is to
get a binary distribution. In the binary distribution everything is
pre-compiled for your particular machine architecture and operating
system, so all you should have to do is install the binaries and
libraries in suitable places. The user guide describes how to do this.
</para>

<para>
A binary distribution may not work for you for two reasons.  First, we
may not have built the suite for the particular architecture/OS
platform you want. That may be due to lack of time and energy (in
which case you can get a source distribution and build from it; see
below).  Alternatively, it may be because we haven't yet ported the
suite to your architecture, in which case you are considerably worse
off.
</para>

<para>
The second reason a binary distribution may not be what you want is
if you want to read or modify the souce code.
</para>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><IndexTerm><Primary>Source distribution</Primary></IndexTerm>Source distribution.</Term>
<ListItem>
<para>
You have a supported
platform, but (a)&nbsp;you like the warm fuzzy feeling of compiling things
yourself; (b)&nbsp;you want to build something ``extra''&mdash;e.g., a set of
libraries with strictness-analysis turned off; or (c)&nbsp;you want to hack
on GHC yourself.
</para>

<para>
A source distribution contains complete sources for one or more
projects in the <Literal>fptools</Literal> suite.  Not only that, but
the more awkward machine-independent steps are done for you.  For
example, if you don't have
<Command>happy</Command><IndexTerm><Primary>happy</Primary></IndexTerm>
you'll find it convenient that the source distribution contains the
result of running <Command>happy</Command> on the parser
specifications.  If you don't want to alter the parser then this saves
you having to find and install <Command>happy</Command>. You will
still need a working version of GHC (preferably version 4.08+) on your
machine in order to compile (most of) the sources, however.
</para>

</ListItem></VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Build GHC from intermediate C <Filename>.hc</Filename> files<IndexTerm><Primary>hc files</Primary></IndexTerm>:</Term>
<ListItem>
<para>
You
need a working GHC to use a source distribution. What if you don't
have a working GHC? Then you have no choice but to ``bootstrap'' up
from the intermediate C (<Filename>.hc</Filename>) files that we provide.  Building GHC
on an unsupported platform falls into this category.  Please see
<Xref LinkEnd="sec-booting-from-C">.
</para>

<para>
Once you have built GHC, you can build the other Glasgow tools with
it.
</para>

<para>
In theory, you can (could?) build GHC with another Haskell compiler
(e.g., HBC). We haven't tried to do this for ages and it almost
certainly doesn't work any more (for tedious reasons).
</para>
</ListItem></VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>The CVS repository.</Term>
<ListItem>
<para>
We make releases infrequently.  If you want more up-to-the minute (but
less tested) source code then you need to get access to our CVS
repository.
</para>

<para>All the <Literal>fptools</Literal> source code is held in a CVS
repository. CVS is a pretty good source-code control system, and best
of all it works over the network.</para>

<para>The repository holds source code only. It holds no mechanically
generated files at all.  So if you check out a source tree from CVS
you will need to install every utility so that you can build all the
derived files from scratch.</para>

<para>More information about our CVS repository is available in the

source distribution or the CVS repository) then you need to read all

<Title>Things to check before you start</Title>

<para>
Here's a list of things to check before you get started.

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
<IndexTerm><Primary>Disk space needed</Primary></IndexTerm>
Disk space needed: About 40MB (one tenth of one hamburger's worth) of disk
space for the most basic binary distribution of GHC; more for some
platforms, e.g., Alphas.  An extra ``bundle'' (e.g., concurrent Haskell
libraries) might take you to up to one fifth of a hamburger. You'll need
over 100MB (say, one fifth a hamburger's worth) if you need to build the
basic stuff from scratch. All of the above are
<Emphasis>estimates</Emphasis> of disk-space needs. (Note: our benchmark hamburger is a standard Double Whopper with Cheese, with an RRP of UKP2.99.)
</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
Use an appropriate machine, compilers, and things.  SPARC boxes, and
PCs running Linux, BSD (any variant), or Solaris are all fully
supported.  Win32 and HP boxes are in pretty good shape.  DEC Alphas
running OSF/1, Linux or some BSD variant, MIPS and AIX boxes will need
some minimal porting effort before they work (as of 4.06).  <Xref

<Title>Build trees
<IndexTerm><Primary>build trees</Primary></IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm><Primary>link trees, for building</Primary></IndexTerm></Title>

<para>
While you can build a system in the source tree, we don't recommend it.
We often want to build multiple versions of our software
for different architectures, or with different options (e.g. profiling).
It's very desirable to share a single copy of the source code among
all these builds.
</para>

<para>
So for every source tree we have zero or more <Emphasis>build trees</Emphasis>.  Each
build tree is initially an exact copy of the source tree, except that
each file is a symbolic link to the source file, rather than being a
copy of the source file.  There are ``standard'' Unix utilities that
make such copies, so standard that they go by different names:
<Command>lndir</Command><IndexTerm><Primary>lndir</Primary></IndexTerm>, <Command>mkshadowdir</Command><IndexTerm><Primary>mkshadowdir</Primary></IndexTerm> are two (If you
don't have either, the source distribution includes sources for the
X11 <Command>lndir</Command>&mdash;check out <Filename>fptools/glafp-utils/lndir</Filename>). See <Xref LinkEnd="sec-storysofar"> for a typical invocation.
</para>

<para>
The build tree does not need to be anywhere near the source tree in
the file system.  Indeed, one advantage of separating the build tree
from the source is that the build tree can be placed in a
non-backed-up partition, saving your systems support people from
backing up untold megabytes of easily-regenerated, and
rapidly-changing, gubbins.  The golden rule is that (with a single
exception&mdash;<XRef LinkEnd="sec-build-config">)
<Emphasis>absolutely everything in the build tree is either a symbolic
link to the source tree, or else is mechanically generated</Emphasis>.
It should be perfectly OK for your build tree to vanish overnight; an
hour or two compiling and you're on the road again.
</para>

<para>
You need to be a bit careful, though, that any new files you create
(if you do any development work) are in the source tree, not a build tree!
</para>

<para>
Remember, that the source files in the build tree are <Emphasis>symbolic
links</Emphasis> to the files in the source tree.  (The build tree soon
accumulates lots of built files like <Filename>Foo.o</Filename>, as well.)  You
can <Emphasis>delete</Emphasis> a source file from the build tree without affecting
the source tree (though it's an odd thing to do).  On the other hand,
if you <Emphasis>edit</Emphasis> a source file from the build tree, you'll edit the
source-tree file directly.  (You can set up Emacs so that if you edit
a source file from the build tree, Emacs will silently create an
edited copy of the source file in the build tree, leaving the source
file unchanged; but the danger is that you think you've edited the
source file whereas actually all you've done is edit the build-tree
copy.  More commonly you do want to edit the source file.)
</para>

<para>
Like the source tree, the top level of your build tree must be (a
linked copy of) the root directory of the <Literal>fptools</Literal> suite.  Inside
Makefiles, the root of your build tree is called
<Constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP</Primary></IndexTerm>.  In the rest of this document path
names are relative to <Constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</Constant> unless otherwise stated.  For
example, the file <Filename>ghc/mk/target.mk</Filename> is actually
<Filename><Constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</Constant>/ghc/mk/target.mk</Filename>.
</para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="sec-build-config">
<Title>Getting the build you want
</Title>

<para>
When you build <Literal>fptools</Literal> you will be compiling code on a particular
<Emphasis>host platform</Emphasis>, to run on a particular <Emphasis>target platform</Emphasis>
(usually the same as the host platform)<IndexTerm><Primary>platform</Primary></IndexTerm>.  The
difficulty is that there are minor differences between different
platforms; minor, but enough that the code needs to be a bit different
for each.  There are some big differences too: for a different
architecture we need to build GHC with a different native-code
generator.
</para>

<para>
There are also knobs you can turn to control how the <Literal>fptools</Literal>
software is built.  For example, you might want to build GHC optimised
(so that it runs fast) or unoptimised (so that you can compile it fast
after you've modified it.  Or, you might want to compile it with
debugging on (so that extra consistency-checking code gets included)
or off.  And so on.
</para>

<para>
All of this stuff is called the <Emphasis>configuration</Emphasis> of your build.
You set the configuration using a three-step process.

<Term>Step 3: build configuration.</Term>
<ListItem>
<para>
Next, you say how this build of <Literal>fptools</Literal> is to differ from the
standard defaults by creating a new file <Filename>mk/build.mk</Filename><IndexTerm><Primary>build.mk</Primary></IndexTerm>
<Emphasis>in the build tree</Emphasis>.  This file is the one and only file you edit
in the build tree, precisely because it says how this build differs
from the source.  (Just in case your build tree does die, you might
want to keep a private directory of <Filename>build.mk</Filename> files, and use a
symbolic link in each build tree to point to the appropriate one.)  So
<Filename>mk/build.mk</Filename> never exists in the source tree&mdash;you create one in
each build tree from the template.  We'll discuss what to put in it
shortly.  
</para>
</ListItem></VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
</para>

<para>
And that's it for configuration. Simple, eh?
</para>

      <para>What do you put in your build-specific configuration file
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename>?  <Emphasis>For almost all
      purposes all you will do is put make variable definitions that
      override those in</Emphasis>
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>.  The whole point of
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>&mdash;and its derived
      counterpart <filename>mk/config.mk</filename>&mdash;is to define
      the build configuration. It is heavily commented, as you will
      see if you look at it.  So generally, what you do is look at
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>, and add definitions in
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> that override any of the
      <filename>config.mk</filename> definitions that you want to
      change.  (The override occurs because the main boilerplate file,
      <filename>mk/boilerplate.mk</filename><IndexTerm><Primary>boilerplate.mk</Primary></IndexTerm>,
      includes <filename>build.mk</filename> after
      <filename>config.mk</filename>.)</para>

      <para>For example, <filename>config.mk.in</filename> contains
      the definition:</para>

<ProgramListing>
GhcHcOpts=-O -Rghc-timing
</ProgramListing>

      <para>The accompanying comment explains that this is the list of
      flags passed to GHC when building GHC itself.  For doing
      development, it is wise to add <literal>-DDEBUG</literal>, to
      enable debugging code.  So you would add the following to
      <filename>build.mk</filename>:</para>

      <para>or, if you prefer,</para>

<ProgramListing>
GhcHcOpts += -DDEBUG
</ProgramListing>

      <para>GNU <Command>make</Command> allows existing definitions to
      have new text appended using the ``<Literal>+=</Literal>''
      operator, which is quite a convenient feature.)</para>

      <para>If you want to remove the <literal>-O</literal> as well (a
      good idea when developing, because the turn-around cycle gets a
      lot quicker), you can just override
      <literal>GhcLibHcOpts</literal> altogether:</para>

<ProgramListing>
GhcHcOpts=-DDEBUG -Rghc-timing
</ProgramListing>

      <para>When reading <filename>config.mk.in</filename>, remember
      that anything between ``@...@'' signs is going to be substituted
      by <Command>configure</Command> later.  You
      <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> override the resulting definition if
      you want, but you need to be a bit surer what you are doing.
      For example, there's a line that says:</para>

<ProgramListing>
YACC = @YaccCmd@
</ProgramListing>

      <para>This defines the Make variables <Constant>YACC</Constant>
      to the pathname for a <Command>yacc</Command> that
      <Command>configure</Command> finds somewhere.  If you have your
      own pet <Command>yacc</Command> you want to use instead, that's
      fine. Just add this line to <filename>mk/build.mk</filename>:</para>

<ProgramListing>
YACC = myyacc
</ProgramListing>

      <para>You do not <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> to have a
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> file at all; if you don't,
      you'll get all the default settings from
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>.</para>

      <para>You can also use <filename>build.mk</filename> to override
      anything that <Command>configure</Command> got wrong.  One place
      where this happens often is with the definition of
      <Constant>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP&lowbar;ABS</Constant>: this
      variable is supposed to be the canonical path to the top of your
      source tree, but if your system uses an automounter then the
      correct directory is hard to find automatically.  If you find
      that <Command>configure</Command> has got it wrong, just put the
      correct definition in <filename>build.mk</filename>.</para>

<Title>The story so far</Title>

<para>
Let's summarise the steps you need to carry to get yourself
a fully-configured build tree from scratch.
</para>

<para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Get your source tree from somewhere (CVS repository or source
distribution).  Say you call the root directory <filename>myfptools</filename> (it
does not have to be called <filename>fptools</filename>).  Make sure that you have
the essential files (see <XRef LinkEnd="sec-source-tree">).

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Use <Command>lndir</Command> or <Command>mkshadowdir</Command> to create a build tree.

<ProgramListing>
cd myfptools
mkshadowdir . /scratch/joe-bloggs/myfptools-sun4
</ProgramListing>

(N.B. <Command>mkshadowdir</Command>'s first argument is taken relative to its second.) You probably want to give the build tree a name that
suggests its main defining characteristic (in your mind at least),
in case you later add others.

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Change directory to the build tree.  Everything is going
to happen there now.

<ProgramListing>
cd /scratch/joe-bloggs/myfptools-sun4
</ProgramListing>

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Prepare for system configuration:

<ProgramListing>
autoconf
</ProgramListing>

(You can skip this step if you are starting from a source distribution,
and you already have <filename>configure</filename> and <filename>mk/config.h.in</filename>.)

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Do system configuration:

<ProgramListing>
./configure
</ProgramListing>


</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Create the file <filename>mk/build.mk</filename>, 
adding definitions for your desired configuration options.

<ProgramListing>
emacs mk/build.mk
</ProgramListing>

</para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

You can make subsequent changes to <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> as often
as you like.  You do not have to run any further configuration programs to
make these changes take effect. In theory you should, however, say
<Command>gmake clean</Command>, <Command>gmake all</Command>, because
configuration option changes could affect anything&mdash;but in practice you
are likely to know what's affected.

      <Title>Making things</Title>

      <para>At this point you have made yourself a fully-configured

      must use GNU <Command>make</Command>, usually called
      <Command>gmake</Command>, not standard Unix
      <Command>make</Command></Emphasis>.  If you use standard Unix
      <Command>make</Command> you will get all sorts of error messages
      (but no damage) because the <Literal>fptools</Literal>
      <Command>Makefiles</Command> use GNU <Command>make</Command>'s
      facilities extensively.</para>

      <para>To just build the whole thing, <command>cd</command> to

<para>
Sometimes the dependencies get in the way: if you've made a small
change to one file, and you're absolutely sure that it won't affect
anything else, but you know that <Command>make</Command> is going to rebuild everything
anyway, the following hack may be useful:
</para>

<para>

<ProgramListing>
gmake FAST=YES 
</ProgramListing>

</para>

<para>
This tells the make system to ignore dependencies and just build what
you tell it to.  In other words, it's equivalent to temporarily
removing the <filename>.depend</filename> file in the current directory (where
<Command>mkdependHS</Command> and friends store their dependency information).
</para>

<para>
A bit of history: GHC used to come with a <Command>fastmake</Command> script that did
the above job, but GNU make provides the features we need to do it
without resorting to a script.  Also, we've found that fastmaking is
less useful since the advent of GHC's recompilation checker (see the
User's Guide section on "Separate Compilation").

<Title>A small project</Title>

<para>
To get started, let us look at the <filename>Makefile</filename> for an imaginary small
<Literal>fptools</Literal> project, <Literal>small</Literal>.  Each project in <Literal>fptools</Literal> has its own
directory in <Constant>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP</Constant>, so the <Literal>small</Literal> project will have its own
directory <Constant>FPOOLS&lowbar;TOP/small/</Constant>.  Inside the <filename>small/</filename> directory there
will be a <filename>Makefile</filename>, looking something like this:
</para>

<para>
<IndexTerm><Primary>Makefile, minimal</Primary></IndexTerm>

<ProgramListing>
#     Makefile for fptools project "small"

TOP = ..
include $(TOP)/mk/boilerplate.mk

SRCS = $(wildcard *.lhs) $(wildcard *.c)
HS_PROG = small

include $(TOP)/target.mk
</ProgramListing>

</para>

<para>
This <filename>Makefile</filename> has three sections:
</para>

<para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 The first section includes
<FOOTNOTE>

<para>
One of the most important
features of GNU <Command>make</Command> that we use is the ability for a <filename>Makefile</filename> to
include another named file, very like <Command>cpp</Command>'s <Literal>&num;include</Literal>
directive.
</para>

</FOOTNOTE>
 a file of ``boilerplate'' code from the level
above (which in this case will be
<filename><Constant>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP</Constant>/mk/boilerplate.mk</filename><IndexTerm><Primary>boilerplate.mk</Primary></IndexTerm>).  As its name
suggests, <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> consists of a large quantity of standard
<filename>Makefile</filename> code.  We discuss this boilerplate in more detail in
<XRef LinkEnd="sec-boiler">.
<IndexTerm><Primary>include, directive in Makefiles</Primary></IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm><Primary>Makefile inclusion</Primary></IndexTerm>

Before the <Literal>include</Literal> statement, you must define the <Command>make</Command> variable
<Constant>TOP</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>TOP</Primary></IndexTerm> to be the directory containing the <filename>mk</filename> directory in
which the <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> file is.  It is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> OK to simply say


<ProgramListing>
include ../mk/boilerplate.mk  # NO NO NO
</ProgramListing>


Why?  Because the <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> file needs to know where it is, so
that it can, in turn, <Literal>include</Literal> other files.  (Unfortunately, when an
<Literal>include</Literal>d file does an <Literal>include</Literal>, the filename is treated relative to
the directory in which <Command>gmake</Command> is being run, not the directory in
which the <Literal>include</Literal>d sits.)  In general, <Emphasis>every file <filename>foo.mk</filename>
assumes that <filename><Constant>&dollar;(TOP)</Constant>/mk/foo.mk</filename> refers to itself.</Emphasis> It is up to the
<filename>Makefile</filename> doing the <Literal>include</Literal> to ensure this is the case.

Files intended for inclusion in other <filename>Makefile</filename>s are written to have
the following property: <Emphasis>after <filename>foo.mk</filename> is <Literal>include</Literal>d, it leaves
<Constant>TOP</Constant> containing the same value as it had just before the <Literal>include</Literal>
statement</Emphasis>.  In our example, this invariant guarantees that the
<Literal>include</Literal> for <filename>target.mk</filename> will look in the same directory as that for
<filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>.

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 The second section defines the following standard <Command>make</Command>
variables: <Constant>SRCS</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>SRCS</Primary></IndexTerm> (the source files from which is to be
built), and <Constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>HS&lowbar;PROG</Primary></IndexTerm> (the executable binary to be
built).  We will discuss in more detail what the ``standard
variables'' are, and how they affect what happens, in <XRef LinkEnd="sec-targets">.

The definition for <Constant>SRCS</Constant> uses the useful GNU <Command>make</Command> construct
<Literal>&dollar;(wildcard&nbsp;$pat$)</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>wildcard</Primary></IndexTerm>, which expands to a list of all
the files matching the pattern <Literal>pat</Literal> in the current directory.  In
this example, <Constant>SRCS</Constant> is set to the list of all the <filename>.lhs</filename> and <filename>.c</filename>
files in the directory.  (Let's suppose there is one of each,
<filename>Foo.lhs</filename> and <filename>Baz.c</filename>.)

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 The last section includes a second file of standard code,
called <filename>target.mk</filename><IndexTerm><Primary>target.mk</Primary></IndexTerm>.  It contains the rules that tell
<Command>gmake</Command> how to make the standard targets (<Xref LinkEnd="sec-standard-targets">).  Why, you ask,
can't this standard code be part of <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>?  Good question.
We discuss the reason later, in <Xref LinkEnd="sec-boiler-arch">.

You do not <Emphasis>have</Emphasis> to <Literal>include</Literal> the <filename>target.mk</filename> file.  Instead, you
can write rules of your own for all the standard targets.  Usually,
though, you will find quite a big payoff from using the canned rules
in <filename>target.mk</filename>; the price tag is that you have to understand what
canned rules get enabled, and what they do (<Xref LinkEnd="sec-targets">).

</para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

</para>

<para>
In our example <filename>Makefile</filename>, most of the work is done by the two
<Literal>include</Literal>d files.  When you say <Command>gmake all</Command>, the following things
happen:
</para>

<para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 <Command>gmake</Command> figures out that the object files are <filename>Foo.o</filename> and
<filename>Baz.o</filename>.

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 It uses a boilerplate pattern rule to compile <filename>Foo.lhs</filename> to
<filename>Foo.o</filename> using a Haskell compiler.  (Which one?  That is set in the
build configuration.)

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 It uses another standard pattern rule to compile <filename>Baz.c</filename> to
<filename>Baz.o</filename>, using a C compiler.  (Ditto.)

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 It links the resulting <filename>.o</filename> files together to make <Literal>small</Literal>,
using the Haskell compiler to do the link step.  (Why not use <Command>ld</Command>?
Because the Haskell compiler knows what standard libraries to link in.
How did <Command>gmake</Command> know to use the Haskell compiler to do the link,
rather than the C compiler?  Because we set the variable <Constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</Constant>
rather than <Constant>C&lowbar;PROG</Constant>.)

</para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</para>

<para>
All <filename>Makefile</filename>s should follow the above three-section format.
</para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>A larger project</Title>

<para>
Larger projects are usually structured into a number of sub-directories,
each of which has its own <filename>Makefile</filename>.  (In very large projects, this
sub-structure might be iterated recursively, though that is rare.)
To give you the idea, here's part of the directory structure for
the (rather large) GHC project:
</para>

<para>

<Screen>
$(FPTOOLS_TOP)/ghc/
  Makefile
  mk/
    boilerplate.mk
    rules.mk
   docs/
    Makefile
    ...source files for documentation...
   driver/
    Makefile
    ...source files for driver...
   compiler/
    Makefile
    parser/...source files for parser...
    renamer/...source files for renamer...
    ...etc...
</Screen>

</para>

<para>
The sub-directories <filename>docs</filename>, <filename>driver</filename>, <filename>compiler</filename>, and so on, each
contains a sub-component of GHC, and each has its own <filename>Makefile</filename>.
There must also be a <filename>Makefile</filename> in <filename><Constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</Constant>/ghc</filename>.  It does most
of its work by recursively invoking <Command>gmake</Command> on the <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the
sub-directories.  We say that <filename>ghc/Makefile</filename> is a <Emphasis>non-leaf
<filename>Makefile</filename></Emphasis>, because it does little except organise its children,
while the <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the sub-directories are all <Emphasis>leaf
<filename>Makefile</filename>s</Emphasis>.  (In principle the sub-directories might themselves
contain a non-leaf <filename>Makefile</filename> and several sub-sub-directories, but
that does not happen in GHC.)
</para>

<para>
The <filename>Makefile</filename> in <filename>ghc/compiler</filename> is considered a leaf <filename>Makefile</filename> even
though the <filename>ghc/compiler</filename> has sub-directories, because these sub-directories
do not themselves have <filename>Makefile</filename>s in them.  They are just used to structure
the collection of modules that make up GHC, but all are managed by the
single <filename>Makefile</filename> in <filename>ghc/compiler</filename>.
</para>

<para>
You will notice that <filename>ghc/</filename> also contains a directory <filename>ghc/mk/</filename>.  It
contains GHC-specific <filename>Makefile</filename> boilerplate code.  More precisely:
</para>

<para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 <filename>ghc/mk/boilerplate.mk</filename> is included at the top of
<filename>ghc/Makefile</filename>, and of all the leaf <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the
sub-directories.  It in turn <Literal>include</Literal>s the main boilerplate file
<filename>mk/boilerplate.mk</filename>.


</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 <filename>ghc/mk/target.mk</filename> is <Literal>include</Literal>d at the bottom of
<filename>ghc/Makefile</filename>, and of all the leaf <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the
sub-directories.  It in turn <Literal>include</Literal>s the file <filename>mk/target.mk</filename>.

</para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</para>

<para>
So these two files are the place to look for GHC-wide customisation
of the standard boilerplate.

<filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> needs to be <Literal>include</Literal>d at the <Emphasis>top</Emphasis>
of each <filename>Makefile</filename>, so that the user can replace the
boilerplate definitions or pattern rules by simply giving a new
definition or pattern rule in the <filename>Makefile</filename>.  <Command>gmake</Command>
simply takes the last definition as the definitive one.

Instead of <Emphasis>replacing</Emphasis> boilerplate definitions, it is also quite
common to <Emphasis>augment</Emphasis> them. For example, a <filename>Makefile</filename> might say:


<ProgramListing>
SRC_HC_OPTS += -O
</ProgramListing>


thereby adding ``<Option>-O</Option>'' to the end of <Constant>SRC&lowbar;HC&lowbar;OPTS</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>SRC&lowbar;HC&lowbar;OPTS</Primary></IndexTerm>.

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 <filename>target.mk</filename> contains <Command>make</Command> rules for the standard
targets described in <Xref LinkEnd="sec-standard-targets">.  These rules are selectively included,
depending on the setting of certain <Command>make</Command> variables.  These
variables are usually set in the middle section of the
<filename>Makefile</filename> between the two <Literal>include</Literal>s.

<filename>target.mk</filename> must be included at the end (rather than being part of
<filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>) for several tiresome reasons:


<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 <Command>gmake</Command> commits target and dependency lists earlier than
it should.  For example, <FIlename>target.mk</FIlename> has a rule that looks like
this: 


<ProgramListing>
$(HS_PROG) : $(OBJS)
      $(HC) $(LD_OPTS) $&#60; -o $@
</ProgramListing>


If this rule was in <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> then <Constant>&dollar;(HS&lowbar;PROG)</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>HS&lowbar;PROG</Primary></IndexTerm>
and <Constant>&dollar;(OBJS)</Constant><IndexTerm><Primary>OBJS</Primary></IndexTerm> would not have their final values at the
moment <Command>gmake</Command> encountered the rule.  Alas, <Command>gmake</Command> takes a snapshot
of their current values, and wires that snapshot into the rule.  (In
contrast, the commands executed when the rule ``fires'' are only
substituted at the moment of firing.)  So, the rule must follow the
definitions given in the <filename>Makefile</filename> itself.

</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 Unlike pattern rules, ordinary rules cannot be overriden or
replaced by subsequent rules for the same target (at least, not without an
error message).  Including ordinary rules in <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename> would
prevent the user from writing rules for specific targets in specific cases.

Any or all of these definitions can easily be overriden by giving new

What, exactly, does <filename>paths.mk</filename> consider a ``source file'' to be?  It's
based on the file's suffix (e.g. <filename>.hs</filename>, <filename>.lhs</filename>, <filename>.c</filename>, <filename>.lc</filename>, etc), but
this is the kind of detail that changes, so rather than
enumerate the source suffices here the best thing to do is to look in

GNU <Command>make</Command> treats double-colon rules as separate entities.  If there
are several double-colon rules for the same target it takes each in
turn and fires it if its dependencies say to do so.  This means that
you can, for example, define both <Constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</Constant> and <Constant>LIBRARY</Constant>, which will
generate two rules for <Literal>install</Literal>.  When you type <Command>gmake install</Command> both
rules will be fired, and both the program and the library will be
installed, just as you wanted.

<Sect2 id="sec-ways">
<Title>Way management

<IndexTerm><Primary>way management</Primary></IndexTerm></Title>

<para>
We sometimes want to build essentially the same system in several
different ``ways''.  For example, we want to build GHC's <Literal>Prelude</Literal>
libraries with and without profiling, with and without concurrency,
and so on, so that there is an appropriately-built library archive to
link with when the user compiles his program.  It would be possible to
have a completely separate build tree for each such ``way'', but it
would be horribly bureaucratic, especially since often only parts of
the build tree need to be constructed in multiple ways.
</para>

<para>
Instead, the <filename>target.mk</filename><IndexTerm><Primary>target.mk</Primary></IndexTerm> contains some clever magic to
allow you to build several versions of a system; and to control
locally how many versions are built and how they differ.  This section
explains the magic.
</para>

<para>
The files for a particular way are distinguished by munging the
suffix.  The ``normal way'' is always built, and its files have the
standard suffices <filename>.o</filename>, <filename>.hi</filename>, and so on.  In addition, you can build
one or more extra ways, each distinguished by a <Emphasis>way tag</Emphasis>.  The
object files and interface files for one of these extra ways are
distinguished by their suffix.  For example, way <Literal>mp</Literal> has files
<filename>.mp&lowbar;o</filename> and <filename>.mp&lowbar;hi</filename>.  Library archives have their way tag the other
side of the dot, for boring reasons; thus, <filename>libHS&lowbar;mp.a</filename>.
</para>

<para>
A <Command>make</Command> variable called <Constant>way</Constant> holds the current way tag.  <Emphasis><Constant>way</Constant>
is only ever set on the command line of a recursive invocation of
<Command>gmake</Command>.</Emphasis> It is never set inside a <filename>Makefile</filename>.  So it is a global
constant for any one invocation of <Command>gmake</Command>.  Two other <Command>make</Command>
variables, <Constant>way&lowbar;</Constant> and <Constant>&lowbar;way</Constant> are immediately derived from <Constant>&dollar;(way)</Constant> and
never altered.  If <Constant>way</Constant> is not set, then neither are <Constant>way&lowbar;</Constant> and
<Constant>&lowbar;way</Constant>, and the invocation of <Command>make</Command> will build the ``normal way''.
If <Constant>way</Constant> is set, then the other two variables are set in sympathy.
For example, if <Constant>&dollar;(way)</Constant> is ``<Literal>mp</Literal>'', then <Constant>way&lowbar;</Constant> is set to ``<Literal>mp&lowbar;</Literal>''
and <Constant>&lowbar;way</Constant> is set to ``<Literal>&lowbar;mp</Literal>''.  These three variables are then used
when constructing file names.
</para>

<para>
So how does <Command>make</Command> ever get recursively invoked with <Constant>way</Constant> set?  There
are two ways in which this happens:
</para>

<para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<para>
 For some (but not all) of the standard targets, when in a leaf
sub-directory, <Command>make</Command> is recursively invoked for each way tag in
<Constant>&dollar;(WAYS)</Constant>.  You set <Constant>WAYS</Constant> to the list of way tags you want these
targets built for.  The mechanism here is very much like the recursive
invocation of <Command>make</Command> in sub-directories (<Xref LinkEnd="sec-subdirs">).

It is up to you to set <Constant>WAYS</Constant> in your <filename>Makefile</filename>; this is how you
control what ways will get built.  
</para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<para>
 For a useful collection of
targets (such as <filename>libHS&lowbar;mp.a</filename>, <filename>Foo.mp&lowbar;o</filename>) there is a rule which
recursively invokes <Command>make</Command> to make the specified target, setting the
<Constant>way</Constant> variable.  So if you say <Command>gmake Foo.mp&lowbar;o</Command> you should see a
recursive invocation <Command>gmake Foo.mp&lowbar;o way=mp</Command>, and <Emphasis>in this
recursive invocation the pattern rule for compiling a Haskell file
into a <filename>.o</filename> file will match</Emphasis>.  The key pattern rules (in <filename>suffix.mk</filename>)
look like this:


<ProgramListing>
%.$(way_)o : %.lhs
      $(HC) $(HC_OPTS) $&#60; -o $@

Sometimes the canned rule just doesn't do the right thing.  For

timing information.  The thing to do here is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to define
<Constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</Constant> or <Constant>C&lowbar;PROG</Constant>, and instead define a special purpose rule in
your own <filename>Makefile</filename>.  By using different variable names you will avoid

This section is for people trying to get GHC going by using the supplied

The intermediate C files are normally made available together with a source

find them. If we haven't made them available or you can't find them, please

Assuming you've got them, unpack them on top of a fresh source tree.  This
will place matching <filename>.hc</filename> files next to the corresponding

The actual build process is fully automated by the
<filename>hc-build</filename> script located in the
<filename>distrib</filename> directory.  If you eventually want to install GHC

By default, the installation directory is <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  If
that is what you want, you may omit the argument to
<filename>hc-build</filename>.  Generally, any option given to
<filename>hc-build</filename> is passed through to the configuration script
<filename>configure</filename>.  If <filename>hc-build</filename>
successfully completes the build process, you can install the resulting
system, as normal, with
