    • Couldn't match type ‘'Many’ with ‘'Many’
      Expected: a -> b
        Actual: a -> b
      ‘m’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: forall a b. a -> b
        at LinearVar.hs:4:1-14
    • In the expression: undefined :: a -> b
      In an equation for ‘f’: f = undefined :: a -> b
    • Relevant bindings include f :: a -> b (bound at LinearVar.hs:5:1)
