    Couldn't match type ‘Depend a0’ with ‘Depend a’
    NB: ‘Depend’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: [Depend a] -> Bool
      Actual type: [Depend a0] -> Bool
    When checking that ‘isValid’ has the inferred type
      isValid :: forall a. Bug a => [Depend a] -> Bool
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
