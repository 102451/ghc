T5462No2.hs:27:42:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘GFunctor F’:
      Both DerivingViaGenerics and GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving are enabled
    In the newtype declaration for ‘F’

T5462No2.hs:29:23:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘C1 G’:
      ‘C1’ is not a derivable class
      because its MINIMAL set is not empty
    In the data declaration for ‘G’

T5462No2.hs:30:23:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘C2 H’:
      ‘C2’ is not a derivable class
      because its MINIMAL set is not empty
    In the data declaration for ‘H’
