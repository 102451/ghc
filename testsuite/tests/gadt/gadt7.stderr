    Couldn't match expected type ‘t0’ with actual type ‘r0’
      ‘r0’ is untouchable

    ‘t0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of i1b :: T t1 -> r0 -> t0 at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: r0 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: r0 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T t1 -> r0 -> t0 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
