gadt-escape1.hs:19:58: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘t0’ with ‘ExpGADT Int’
      ‘t0’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: t ~ Int
        bound by a pattern with constructor: ExpInt :: Int -> ExpGADT Int,
                 in a case alternative
        at gadt-escape1.hs:19:43-50
    ‘t0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of weird1 :: t0 at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘weird1’
    Expected type: t0
      Actual type: ExpGADT t
    Relevant bindings include
      weird1 :: t0 (bound at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1)
    In the expression: a
    In a case alternative: Hidden (ExpInt _) a -> a
